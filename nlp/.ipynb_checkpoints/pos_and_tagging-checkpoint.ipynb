Hast thou\\neaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou\\nshouldest not eat?\\nAnd the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me,\\nshe gave me of the tree, and I did eat.\\nAnd the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou\\nhast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I\\ndid eat.\\nAnd the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done\\nthis, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast\\nof the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt\\nthou eat all the days of thy li\\nAnd I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between\\nthy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou\\nshalt bruise his heel.\\nUnto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and\\nthy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and\\nthy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over\\nthee.\\nAnd unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the\\nvoice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I\\ncommanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of  cursed is\\nthe ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all\\nthe days of thy life;\\nThorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and\\nthou shalt eat the herb of the field;\\nIn the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou\\nreturn unto the ground; for out of it wast thou tak for\\ndust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\\nAnd Adam called his wife\\'s name Eve; because she was the\\nmother of all living.\\nUnto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of\\nskins, and clothed them.\\nAnd the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us,\\nto know good and ev and now, lest he put forth his hand,\\nand take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ev\\nTherefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden,\\nto till the ground from whence he was taken.\\nSo he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the\\ngarden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned\\nevery way, to keep the way of the tree of life.\\nAnd Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain,\\nand said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.\\nAnd she again bare his brother Abel.

And unto thee shall be\\nhis desire, and thou shalt rule over him.\\nAnd Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass,\\nwhen they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel\\nhis brother, and slew him.\\nAnd the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he\\nsaid, I know n Am I my brother\\'s keeper?\\nAnd he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother\\'s\\nblood crieth unto me from the ground.\\nAnd now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her\\nmouth to receive thy brother\\'s blood from thy hand;\\nWhen thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield\\nunto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou\\nbe in the earth.\\nAnd Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I\\ncan bear.\\nBehold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the\\nearth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a\\nfugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to\\npass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.\\nAnd the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,\\nvengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a\\nmark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.\\nAnd Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in\\nthe land of Nod, on the east of Eden.\\nAnd Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and\\nhe builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the\\nname of his son, Enoch.\\nAnd unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and\\nMehujael begat Methusa and Methusael begat Lamech.\\nAnd Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was\\nAdah, and the name of the other Zillah.\\nAnd Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in\\ntents, and of such as have cattle.\\nAnd his brother\\'s name was Jubal: he was the father of all\\nsuch as handle the harp and organ.\\nAnd Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructor of every\\nartificer in brass and ir and the sister of Tubalcain was\\nNaamah.\\nAnd Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my\\nvoice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my spee for I have\\nslain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.\\nIf Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and\\nsevenfold.\\nAnd Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called\\nhis name Se For God, said she, hath appointed me another\\nseed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.\\nAnd to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called\\nhis name En then began men to call upon the name of the\\nLORD.\\nThis is the book of the generations of Adam.

Now Jacob had pitched his tent in\\nthe mou and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of\\nGilead.\\nAnd Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast\\nstolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as\\ncaptives taken with the sword?\\nWherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from\\nme; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away\\nwith mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?\\nAnd hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters?\\nthou hast now done foolishly in so doing.\\nIt is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of\\nyour father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed\\nthat thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\\nAnd now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore\\nlongedst after thy father\\'s house, yet wherefore hast thou\\nstolen my gods?\\nAnd Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid:\\nfor I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy\\ndaughters from me.\\nWith whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live:\\nbefore our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and\\ntake it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen\\nthem.\\nAnd Laban went into Jacob\\'s tent, and into Leah\\'s tent, and\\ninto the two maidservants\\' tents; but he found them not. Then\\nwent he out of Leah\\'s tent, and entered into Rachel\\'s tent.\\nNow Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel\\'s\\nfurniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent,\\nbut found them not.\\nAnd she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that\\nI cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon\\nme. And he searched but found not the images.\\nAnd Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered\\nand said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that\\nthou hast so hotly pursued after me?\\nWhereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found\\nof all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and\\nthy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.\\nThis twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she\\ngoats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock\\nhave I not eaten.\\nThat which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare\\nthe loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether\\nstolen by day, or stolen by night.\\nThus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost\\nby night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.\\nThus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee\\nfourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy\\ncatt and thou hast changed my wages ten times.\\nExcept the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear\\nof Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now\\nempty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my\\nhands, and rebuked thee yesternight.\\nAnd Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my\\ndaughters, and these children are my children, and these\\ncattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mi and\\nwhat can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their\\nchildren which they have born?\\nNow therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou;\\nand let it be for a witness between me and thee.\\nAnd Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.\\nAnd Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took\\nstones, and made an he and they did eat there upon the\\nheap.\\nAnd Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it\\nGaleed.\\nAnd Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee\\nthis day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;\\nAnd Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee,\\nwhen we are absent one from another.\\nIf thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take\\nother wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God\\nis witness betwixt me and thee.\\nAnd Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this\\npillar, which I have cast betwixt me and th\\nThis heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will\\nnot pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass\\nover this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.\\nThe God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their\\nfather, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his\\nfather Isaac.\\nThen Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his\\nbrethren to eat bre and they did eat bread, and tarried all\\nnight in the mount.\\nAnd early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons\\nand his daughters, and blessed th and Laban departed, and\\nreturned unto his place.\\nAnd Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.\\nAnd when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God\\'s host: and he\\ncalled the name of that place Mahanaim.\\nAnd Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto\\nthe land of Seir, the country of Edom.\\nAnd he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my\\nlord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with\\nLaban, and stayed there until n\\nAnd I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and\\nwomenservan and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may\\nfind grace in thy sight.\\nAnd the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy\\nbrother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four\\nhundred men with him.\\nThen Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided\\nthe people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and\\nthe camels, into two bands;\\nAnd said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then\\nthe other company which is left shall escape.\\nAnd Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my\\nfather Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy\\ncountry, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with th\\nI am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all\\nthe truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with\\nmy staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two\\nbands.\\nDeliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the\\nhand of Es for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me,\\nand the mother with the children.\\nAnd thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed\\nas the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for\\nmultitude.\\nAnd he lodged there that same night; and took of that which\\ncame to his hand a present for Esau his brother;\\nTwo hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes,\\nand twenty rams,\\nThirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten\\nbulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.\\nAnd he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every\\ndrove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over\\nbefore me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.\\nAnd he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother\\nmeeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and\\nwhither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?\\nThen thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob\\'s; it is a\\npresent sent unto my lord Es and, behold, also he is behind\\nus.\\nAnd so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that\\nfollowed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak\\nunto Esau, when ye find him.\\nAnd say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.\\nFor he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth\\nbefore me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he\\nwill accept of me.\\nSo went the present over before him: and himself lodged that\\nnight in the company.\\nAnd he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two\\nwomenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford\\nJabbok.\\nAnd he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over\\nthat he had.\\nAnd Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him\\nuntil the breaking of the day.\\nAnd when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched\\nthe hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob\\'s thigh was\\nout of joint, as he wrestled with him.\\nAnd he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh.

Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren\\nindeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?\\nAnd his brethren envied him; but his father observed the\\nsaying.\\nAnd his brethren went to feed their father\\'s flock in Shechem.\\nAnd Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the\\nflock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he\\nsaid to him, Here am I.\\nAnd he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well\\nwith thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word\\nagain. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came\\nto Shechem.\\nAnd a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in\\nthe fie and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?\\nAnd he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where\\nthey feed their flocks.\\nAnd the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them\\nsay, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren,\\nand found them in Dothan.\\nAnd when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto\\nthem, they conspired against him to slay him.\\nAnd they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.\\nCome now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into\\nsome pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured h\\nand we shall see what will become of his dreams.\\nAnd Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;\\nand said, Let us not kill him.\\nAnd Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into\\nthis pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him;\\nthat he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to\\nhis father again.\\nAnd it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,\\nthat they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many\\ncolours that was on him;\\nAnd they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was\\nempty, there was no water in it.\\nAnd they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes\\nand looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from\\nGilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh,\\ngoing to carry it down to Egypt.\\nAnd Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay\\nour brother, and conceal his blood?\\nCome, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our\\nhand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his\\nbrethren were content.\\nThen there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and\\nlifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the\\nIshmeelites for twenty pieces of silv and they brought\\nJoseph into Egypt.\\nAnd Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not\\nin the pit; and he rent his clothes.\\nAnd he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;\\nand I, whither shall I go?\\nAnd they took Joseph\\'s coat, and killed a kid of the goats,\\nand dipped the coat in the blood;\\nAnd they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to\\ntheir father; and said, This have we fou know now whether\\nit be thy son\\'s coat or no.\\nAnd he knew it, and said, It is my son\\'s coat; an evil beast\\nhath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.\\nAnd Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,\\nand mourned for his son many days.\\nAnd all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;\\nbut he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go\\ndown into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept\\nfor him.\\nAnd the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an\\nofficer of Pharaoh\\'s, and captain of the guard.\\nAnd it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from\\nhis brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose\\nname was Hirah.\\nAnd Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose\\nname was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.\\nAnd she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.\\nAnd she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his\\nname Onan.\\nAnd she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his\\nname Shel and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.\\nAnd Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was\\nTamar.\\nAnd Er, Judah\\'s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the\\nLORD; and the LORD slew him.\\nAnd Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother\\'s wife, and\\nmarry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.\\nAnd Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to\\npass, when he went in unto his brother\\'s wife, that he spilled\\nit on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his\\nbrother.\\nAnd the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he\\nslew him also.\\nThen said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow\\nat thy father\\'s house, till Shelah my son be gro for he\\nsaid, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And\\nTamar went and dwelt in her father\\'s house.\\nAnd in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah\\'s wife\\ndied; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his\\nsheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the\\nAdullamite.\\nAnd it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth\\nup to Timnath to shear his sheep.\\nAnd she put her widow\\'s garments off from her, and covered her\\nwith a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place,\\nwhich is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was\\ngrown, and she was not given unto him to wife.\\nWhen Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because\\nshe had covered her face.\\nAnd he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray\\nthee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was\\nhis daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me,\\nthat thou mayest come in unto me?\\nAnd he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she\\nsaid, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?\\nAnd he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy\\nsignet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine\\nhand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she\\nconceived by him.\\nAnd she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her,\\nand put on the garments of her widowhood.\\nAnd Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the\\nAdullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman\\'s ha but\\nhe found her not.\\nThen he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the\\nharlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There\\nwas no harlot in this place.\\nAnd he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and\\nalso the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in\\nthis place.\\nAnd Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:\\nbehold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.\\nAnd it came to pass about three months after, that it was told\\nJudah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the\\nharlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And\\nJudah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.\\nWhen she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,\\nsaying, By the man, whose these are, am I with chi and she\\nsaid, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and\\nbracelets, and staff.\\nAnd Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more\\nrighteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my\\nson. And he knew her again no more.\\nAnd it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,\\ntwins were in her womb.\\nAnd it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out\\nhis ha and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a\\nscarlet thread, saying, This came out first.\\nAnd it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold,\\nhis brother came o and she said, How hast thou broken\\nforth? this breach be upon th therefore his name was called\\nPharez.\\nAnd afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet\\nthread upon his ha and his name was called Zarah.\\nAnd Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer\\nof Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of\\nthe hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down\\nthither.\\nAnd the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and\\nhe was in the house of his master the Egyptian.\\nAnd his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the\\nLORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.\\nAnd Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he\\nmade him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put\\ninto his hand.\\nAnd it came to pass from the time that he had made him\\noverseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD\\nblessed the Egyptian\\'s house for Joseph\\'s sake; and the\\nblessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house,\\nand in the field.\\nAnd he left all that he had in Joseph\\'s hand; and he knew not\\nought he had, save the bread which he did eat.

So Noah knew that the waters\\nwere abated from the earth.\\nHe stayed yet another seven days, and sent forth the dove;\\nand she didn\\'t return to him any more.\\nIt happened in the six hundred first year, in the first month,\\nthe first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth.\\nNoah removed the covering of the ship, and looked.\\nHe saw that the surface of the ground was dried.\\nIn the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month,\\nthe earth was dry.\\nGod spoke to Noah, saying,\\n\"Go out of the ship, you, and your wife, and your sons,\\nand your sons\\' wives with you.\\nBring forth with you every living thing that is with you\\nof all flesh, including birds, livestock, and every creeping\\nthing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly\\nin the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth.\"\\nNoah went forth, with his sons, his wife, and his sons\\'\\nwives with him.\\nEvery animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves\\non the earth, after their families, went out of the ship.\\nNoah built an altar to Yahweh, and took of every clean animal,\\nand of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings\\non the altar.\\nYahweh smelled the sweet savor.

I will look at it, that I\\nmay remember the everlasting covenant between God and every\\nliving creature of all flesh that is on the earth.\"\\nGod said to Noah, \"This is the token of the covenant which I\\nhave established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.\"\\nThe sons of Noah who went forth from the ship were Shem, Ham,\\nand Japheth.  Ham is the father of Canaan.\\nThese three were the sons of Noah, and from these, the whole\\nearth was populated.\\nNoah began to be a farmer, and planted a vineyard.\\nHe drank of the wine and got drunk.  He was uncovered\\nwithin his tent.\\nHam, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father,\\nand told his two brothers outside.\\nShem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders,\\nwent in backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father.\\nTheir faces were backwards, and they didn\\'t see\\ntheir father\\'s nakedness.\\nNoah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had\\ndone to him.\\nHe said, \"Canaan is cursed.

Let him dwell in the tents of Shem.\\nLet Canaan be his servant.\"\\nNoah lived three hundred fifty years after the flood.\\nAll the days of Noah were nine hundred fifty years, then he died.\\nNow this is the history of the generations of the sons of Noah\\nand of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.  Sons were born to them\\nafter the flood.\\nThe sons of Japheth:  Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech,\\nand Tiras.\\nThe sons of Gomer:  Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.\\nThe sons of Javan:  Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.\\nOf these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands,\\neveryone after his language, after their families,\\nin their nations.\\nThe sons of Ham:  Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.\\nThe sons of Cush:  Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca.\\nThe sons of Raamah:  Sheba and Dedan.\\nCush became the father of Nimrod.  He began to be a mighty\\none in the earth.\\nHe was a mighty hunter before Yahweh.  Therefore it is said,\\n\"Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before Yahweh.\"\\nThe beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh,\\nin the land of Shinar.\\nOut of that land he went forth into Assyria, and built\\nNineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah,\\nand Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).\\nMizraim became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,\\nPathrusim, Casluhim (which the Philistines descended from),\\nand Caphtorim.\\nCanaan became the father of Sidon (his firstborn), Heth,\\nthe Jebusite, the Amorite, the Girgashite,\\nthe Hivite, the Arkite, the Sinite,\\nthe Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite.\\nAfterward the families of the Canaanites were spread abroad.\\nThe border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as you go\\ntoward Gerar, to Gaza; as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah,\\nand Zeboiim, to Lasha.\\nThese are the sons of Ham, after their families,\\nafter their languages, in their lands, in their nations.\\nTo Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder\\nbrother of Japheth, to him also were children born.\\nThe sons of Shem:  Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.\\nThe sons of Aram:  Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.\\nArpachshad became the father of Shelah.  Shelah became\\nthe father of Eber.\\nTo Eber were born two sons.  The name of the one was Peleg,\\nfor in his days the earth was divided.  His brother\\'s\\nname was Joktan.\\nJoktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,\\nHadoram, Uzal, Diklah,\\nObal, Abimael, Sheba,\\nOphir, Havilah, and Jobab.  All these were the sons of Joktan.\\nTheir dwelling was from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar,\\nthe mountain of the east.\\nThese are the sons of Shem, after their families,\\nafter their languages, in their lands, after their nations.\\nThese are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations,\\nin their nations.  Of these were the nations divided in the earth\\nafter the flood.\\nThe whole earth was of one language and of one speech.\\nIt happened, as they traveled east, that they found a plain\\nin the land of Shinar, and they lived there.\\nThey said one to another, \"Come, let\\'s make bricks, and burn\\nthem thoroughly.\"  They had brick for stone, and they used\\ntar for mortar.\\nThey said, \"Come, let\\'s build ourselves a city, and a tower\\nwhose top reaches to the sky, and let\\'s make ourselves a name,\\nlest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth.\"\\nYahweh came down to see the city and the tower, which the children\\nof men built.\\nYahweh said, \"Behold, they are one people, and they have\\nall one language, and this is what they begin to do.\\nNow nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do.\\nCome, let\\'s go down, and there confuse their language,\\nthat they may not understand one another\\'s speech.\"\\nSo Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface\\nof all the earth.  They stopped building the city.\\nTherefore the name of it was called Babel, because there\\nYahweh confused the language of all the earth.  From there,\\nYahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth.\\nThis is the history of the generations of Shem.  Shem was\\none hundred years old and became the father of Arpachshad\\ntwo years after the flood.\\nShem lived five hundred years after he became the father\\nof Arpachshad, and became the father of sons and daughters.\\nArpachshad lived thirty-five years and became the father of Shelah.\\nArpachshad lived four hundred three years after he became the father\\nof Shelah, and became the father of sons and daughters.\\nShelah lived thirty years, and became the father of Eber:\\nand Shelah lived four hundred three years after he became\\nthe father of Eber, and became the father of sons and daughters.\\nEber lived thirty-four years, and became the father of Peleg.\\nEber lived four hundred thirty years after he became the father\\nof Peleg, and became the father of sons and daughters.\\nPeleg lived thirty years, and became the father of Reu.\\nPeleg lived two hundred nine years after he became the father\\nof Reu, and became the father of sons and daughters.\\nReu lived thirty-two years, and became the father of Serug.\\nReu lived two hundred seven years after he became the father\\nof Serug, and became the father of sons and daughters.\\nSerug lived thirty years, and became the father of Nahor.\\nSerug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor,\\nand became the father of sons and daughters.\\nNahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah.\\nNahor lived one hundred nineteen years after he became the father\\nof Terah, and became the father of sons and daughters.\\nTerah lived seventy years, and became the father\\nof Abram, Nahor, and Haran.\\nNow this is the history of the generations of Terah.\\nTerah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.\\nHaran became the father of Lot.\\nHaran died before his father Terah in the land of his birth,\\nin Ur of the Chaldees.\\nAbram and Nahor took wives.  The name of Abram\\'s wife was Sarai,\\nand the name of Nahor\\'s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran\\nwho was also the father of Iscah.\\nSarai was barren.  She had no child.\\nTerah took Abram his son, Lot the son of Haran, his son\\'s son,\\nand Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram\\'s wife.  They went\\nforth from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan.\\nThey came to Haran and lived there.\\nThe days of Terah were two hundred five years.\\nTerah died in Haran.\\nNow Yahweh said to Abram, \"Get out of your country,\\nand from your relatives, and from your father\\'s house,\\nto the land that I will show you.\\nI will make of you a great nation.  I will bless you and make\\nyour name great.  You will be a blessing.\\nI will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him\\nwho curses you.  In you will all of the families of the\\nearth be blessed.\"\\nSo Abram went, as Yahweh had spoken to him.  Lot went with him.\\nAbram was seventy-five years old when he departed out of Haran.\\nAbram took Sarai his wife, Lot his brother\\'s son, all their substance\\nthat they had gathered, and the souls whom they had gotten\\nin Haran, and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan.\\nInto the land of Canaan they came.\\nAbram passed through the land to the place of Shechem,\\nto the oak of Moreh.  The Canaanite was then in the land.\\nYahweh appeared to Abram and said, \"I will give this land to\\nyour seed.\" He built an altar there to Yahweh,\\nwho appeared to him.\\nHe left from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel,\\nand pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Ai\\non the east.  There he built an altar to Yahweh and called\\non the name of Yahweh.\\nAbram traveled, going on still toward the South.\\nThere was a famine in the land.  Abram went down into Egypt\\nto live as a foreigner there, for the famine was severe\\nin the land.\\nIt happened, when he had come near to enter Egypt, that he said\\nto Sarai his wife, \"See now, I know that you are a beautiful\\nwoman to look at.\\nIt will happen, when the Egyptians will see you, that they\\nwill say, \\'This is his wife.\\'  They will kill me, but they\\nwill save you alive.\\nPlease say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me\\nfor your sake, and that my soul may live because of you.\"\\nIt happened that when Abram had come into Egypt, the Egyptians\\nsaw that the woman was very beautiful.\\nThe princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh;\\nand the woman was taken into Pharaoh\\'s house.\\nHe dealt well with Abram for her sake.  He had sheep,\\noxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants,\\nfemale donkeys, and camels.\\nYahweh plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues\\nbecause of Sarai, Abram\\'s wife.\\nPharaoh called Abram and said, \"What is this that you have done\\nto me?  Why didn\\'t you tell me that she was your wife?\\nWhy did you say, \\'She is my sister,\\' so that I took her\\nto be my wife?  Now therefore, see your wife, take her,\\nand go your way.\"\\nPharaoh gave men charge concerning him, and they brought him\\non the way with his wife and all that he had.\\nAbram went up out of Egypt:  he, his wife, all that he had,\\nand Lot with him, into the South.\\nAbram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.\\nHe went on his journeys from the South even to Bethel,\\nto the place where his tent had been at the beginning,\\nbetween Bethel and Ai,\\nto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first.\\nThere Abram called on the name of Yahweh.\\nLot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.\\nThe land was not able to bear them, that they might live together:\\nfor their substance was great, so that they could not live together.\\nThere was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram\\'s livestock\\nand the herdsmen of Lot\\'s livestock:  and the Canaanite\\nand the Perizzite lived in the land at that time.\\nAbram said to Lot, \"Please, let there be no strife between\\nme and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen;\\nfor we are relatives.\\nIsn\\'t the whole land before you?  Please separate yourself from me.\\nIf you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right.\\nOr if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left.\"\\nLot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan,\\nthat it was well-watered everywhere, before Yahweh destroyed\\nSodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land\\nof Egypt, as you go to Zoar.\\nSo Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself.\\nLot traveled east, and they separated themselves the one\\nfrom the other.\\nAbram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities\\nof the plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.\\nNow the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners\\nagainst Yahweh.\\nYahweh said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, \"Now,\\nlift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are,\\nnorthward and southward and eastward and westward,\\nfor all the land which you see, I will give to you, and to\\nyour offspring forever.\\nI will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that\\nif a man can number the dust of the earth, then your seed\\nmay also be numbered.\\nArise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth\\nof it; for I will give it to you.\"\\nAbram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre,\\nwhich are in Hebron, and built an altar there to Yahweh.\\nIt happened in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch,\\nking of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal,\\nking of Goiim,\\nthat they made war with Bera, king of Sodom, and with Birsha,\\nking of Gomorrah, Shinab, king of Admah, and Shemeber,\\nking of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar).\\nAll these joined together in the valley of Siddim (the same\\nis the Salt Sea).\\nTwelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth\\nyear, they rebelled.\\nIn the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer came, and the kings who\\nwere with him, and struck the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim,\\nand the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim,\\nand the Horites in their Mount Seir, to Elparan, which is\\nby the wilderness.\\nThey returned, and came to En Mishpat (the same is Kadesh),\\nand struck all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites,\\nthat lived in Hazazon Tamar.\\nThe king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king\\nof Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela\\n(the same is Zoar) went out; and they set the battle in array\\nagainst them in the valley of Siddim;\\nagainst Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,\\nand Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar;\\nfour kings against the five.\\nNow the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings\\nof Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and those\\nwho remained fled to the hills.\\nThey took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food,\\nand went their way.\\nThey took Lot, Abram\\'s brother\\'s son, who lived in Sodom,\\nand his goods, and departed.\\nOne who had escaped came and told Abram, the Hebrew.\\nNow he lived by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol,\\nand brother of Aner; and these were allies of Abram.\\nWhen Abram heard that his relative was taken captive, he led forth\\nhis trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen,\\nand pursued as far as Dan.\\nHe divided himself against them by night, he and his servants,\\nand struck them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left\\nhand of Damascus.\\nHe brought back all the goods, and also brought back\\nhis relative, Lot, and his goods, and the women also,\\nand the people.\\nThe king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from\\nthe slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him,\\nat the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King\\'s Valley).\\nMelchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine:\\nand he was priest of God Most High.\\nHe blessed him, and said, \"Blessed be Abram of God Most High,\\npossessor of heaven and earth:\\nand blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies\\ninto your hand.\"  Abram gave him a tenth of all.\\nThe king of Sodom said to Abram, \"Give me the people,\\nand take the goods to yourself.\"\\nAbram said to the king of Sodom, \"I have lifted up my hand\\nto Yahweh, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,\\nthat I will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything\\nthat is yours, lest you should say, \\'I have made Abram rich.\\'\\nI will accept nothing from you except that which the young men\\nhave eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me:\\nAner, Eshcol, and Mamre.  Let them take their portion.\"\\nAfter these things the word of Yahweh came to Abram in\\na vision, saying, \"Don\\'t be afraid, Abram.  I am your shield,\\nyour exceedingly great reward.\"\\nAbram said, \"Lord Yahweh, what will you give me, seeing I\\ngo childless, and he who will inherit my estate is\\nEliezer of Damascus?\"\\nAbram said, \"Behold, to me you have given no seed:\\nand, behold, one born in my house is my heir.\"\\nBehold, the word of Yahweh came to him, saying, \"This man will\\nnot be your heir, but he who will come forth out of your own\\nbody will be your heir.\"\\nYahweh brought him outside, and said, \"Look now toward the sky,\\nand count the stars, if you are able to count them.\"\\nHe said to Abram, \"So shall your seed be.\"\\nHe believed in Yahweh; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.\\nHe said to him, \"I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur\\nof the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it.\"\\nHe said, \"Lord Yahweh, how will I know that I will inherit it?\"\\nHe said to him, \"Bring me a heifer three years old, a female\\ngoat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove,\\nand a young pigeon.\"\\nHe brought him all of these, and divided them in the middle,\\nand laid each half opposite the other; but he didn\\'t\\ndivide the birds.\\nThe birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram\\ndrove them away.\\nWhen the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram.\\nNow terror and great darkness fell on him.\\nHe said to Abram, \"Know for sure that your seed will live as\\nforeigners in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them.\\nThey will afflict them four hundred years.\\nI will also judge that nation, whom they will serve.\\nAfterward they will come out with great wealth,\\nbut you will go to your fathers in peace.

Shouldn\\'t the Judge of all\\nthe earth do right?\"\\nYahweh said, \"If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city,\\nthen I will spare all the place for their sake.\"\\nAbraham answered, \"See now, I have taken it on myself to speak\\nto the Lord, who am but dust and ashes.\\nWhat if there will lack five of the fifty righteous?\\nWill you destroy all the city for lack of five?\"  He said,\\n\"I will not destroy it, if I find forty-five there.\"\\nHe spoke to him yet again, and said, \"What if there are forty\\nfound there?\"  He said, \"I will not do it for the forty\\'s sake.\"\\nHe said, \"Oh don\\'t let the Lord be angry, and I will speak.\\nWhat if there are thirty found there?\"  He said, \"I will not\\ndo it, if I find thirty there.\"\\nHe said, \"See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord.\\nWhat if there are twenty found there?\"  He said, \"I will not\\ndestroy it for the twenty\\'s sake.\"\\nHe said, \"Oh don\\'t let the Lord be angry, and I will\\nspeak just once more.  What if ten are found there?\"\\nHe said, \"I will not destroy it for the ten\\'s sake.\"\\nYahweh went his way, as soon as he had finished communing\\nwith Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.\\nThe two angels came to Sodom at evening.  Lot sat in the gate\\nof Sodom.  Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them.\\nHe bowed himself with his face to the earth,\\nand he said, \"See now, my lords, please turn aside into\\nyour servant\\'s house, stay all night, wash your feet,\\nand you will rise up early, and go on your way.\"\\nThey said, \"No, but we will stay in the street all night.\"\\nHe urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered\\ninto his house.  He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread,\\nand they ate.\\nBut before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom,\\nsurrounded the house, both young and old, all the people\\nfrom every quarter.\\nThey called to Lot, and said to him, \"Where are the men\\nwho came in to you this night?  Bring them out to us,\\nthat we may have sex with them.\"\\nLot went out to them to the door, and shut the door after him.\\nHe said, \"Please, my brothers, don\\'t act so wickedly.\\nSee now, I have two virgin daughters.  Please let me bring them\\nout to you, and you may do to them what seems good to you.\\nOnly don\\'t do anything to these men, because they have come\\nunder the shadow of my roof.\"\\nThey said, \"Stand back!\"  They said, \"This one fellow came\\nin to live as a foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge.\\nNow will we deal worse with you, than with them!\"\\nThey pressed hard on the man Lot, and drew near to break the door.\\nBut the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house\\nto them, and shut the door.\\nThey struck the men who were at the door of the house\\nwith blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied\\nthemselves to find the door.\\nThe men said to Lot, \"Do you have anybody else here?\\nSons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whoever you\\nhave in the city, bring them out of the place:\\nfor we will destroy this place, because the outcry against\\nthem has grown great before Yahweh that Yahweh has sent us\\nto destroy it.\"\\nLot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were\\npledged to marry his daughters, and said, \"Get up!\\nGet out of this place, for Yahweh will destroy the city.\"\\nBut he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking.\\nWhen the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot, saying, \"Get up!\\nTake your wife, and your two daughters who are here,\\nlest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.\"\\nBut he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife\\'s hand,\\nand his two daughters\\' hands, Yahweh being merciful to him;\\nand they took him out, and set him outside of the city.\\nIt came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said,\\n\"Escape for your life!  Don\\'t look behind you, and don\\'t\\nstay anywhere in the plain.  Escape to the mountains,\\nlest you be consumed!\"\\nLot said to them, \"Oh, not so, my lord.\\nSee now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you\\nhave magnified your loving kindness, which you have shown\\nto me in saving my life.  I can\\'t escape to the mountain,\\nlest evil overtake me, and I die.\\nSee now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one.\\nOh let me escape there (isn\\'t it a little one?), and my\\nsoul will live.\"\\nHe said to him, \"Behold, I have granted your request concerning\\nthis thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which\\nyou have spoken.\\nHurry, escape there, for I can\\'t do anything until you get there.\"\\nTherefore the name of the city was called Zoar.\\nThe sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.\\nThen Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire\\nfrom Yahweh out of the sky.\\nHe overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants\\nof the cities, and that which grew on the ground.\\nBut his wife looked back from behind him, and she became\\na pillar of salt.\\nAbraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had\\nstood before Yahweh.\\nHe looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land\\nof the plain, and looked, and saw that the smoke of the land\\nwent up as the smoke of a furnace.\\nIt happened, when God destroyed the cities of the plain,\\nthat God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle\\nof the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.\\nLot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his\\ntwo daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar.\\nHe lived in a cave with his two daughters.\\nThe firstborn said to the younger, \"Our father is old,\\nand there is not a man in the earth to come in to us after\\nthe manner of all the earth.\\nCome, let\\'s make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him,\\nthat we may preserve our father\\'s seed.\"\\nThey made their father drink wine that night:\\nand the firstborn went in, and lay with her father.\\nHe didn\\'t know when she lay down, nor when she arose.\\nIt came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said\\nto the younger, \"Behold, I lay last night with my father.\\nLet us make him drink wine again, tonight.  You go in,\\nand lie with him, that we may preserve our father\\'s seed.\"\\nThey made their father drink wine that night also.\\nThe younger went and lay with him.  He didn\\'t know when she\\nlay down, nor when she got up.\\nThus both of Lot\\'s daughters were with child by their father.\\nThe firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab.  He is the father\\nof the Moabites to this day.\\nThe younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben Ammi.\\nHe is the father of the children of Ammon to this day.\\nAbraham traveled from there toward the land of the South, and lived\\nbetween Kadesh and Shur.  He lived as a foreigner in Gerar.\\nAbraham said about Sarah his wife, \"She is my sister.\"\\nAbimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.\\nBut God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said\\nto him, \"Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman\\nwhom you have taken.  For she is a man\\'s wife.\"\\nNow Abimelech had not come near her.  He said, \"Lord, will you\\nkill even a righteous nation?\\nDidn\\'t he tell me, \\'She is my sister?\\'  She, even she herself,\\nsaid, \\'He is my brother.\\'  In the integrity of my heart\\nand the innocence of my hands have I done this.\"\\nGod said to him in the dream, \"Yes, I know that in the integrity\\nof your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you\\nfrom sinning against me.  Therefore I didn\\'t allow you\\nto touch her.\\nNow therefore, restore the man\\'s wife.  For he is a prophet,\\nand he will pray for you, and you will live.  If you don\\'t\\nrestore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all\\nwho are yours.\"\\nAbimelech rose early in the morning, and called all\\nhis servants, and told all these things in their ear.\\nThe men were very scared.\\nThen Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him,\\n\"What have you done to us?  How have I sinned against you,\\nthat you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin?\\nYou have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!\"\\nAbimelech said to Abraham, \"What did you see, that you have\\ndone this thing?\"\\nAbraham said, \"Because I thought, \\'Surely the fear of God is\\nnot in this place.  They will kill me for my wife\\'s sake.\\'\\nBesides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father,\\nbut not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.\\nIt happened, when God caused me to wander from my father\\'s house,\\nthat I said to her, \\'This is your kindness which you shall show\\nto me.  Everywhere that we go, say of me, \"He is my brother.\"\\'\"\\nAbimelech took sheep and oxen, male servants and female servants,\\nand gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah, his wife, to him.\\nAbimelech said, \"Behold, my land is before you.\\nDwell where it pleases you.\"\\nTo Sarah he said, \"Behold, I have given your brother a thousand\\npieces of silver.  Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes\\nto all that are with you.  In front of all you are vindicated.\"\\nAbraham prayed to God.  God healed Abimelech, and his wife,\\nand his female servants, and they bore children.\\nFor Yahweh had closed up tight all the wombs of the house\\nof Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham\\'s wife.\\nYahweh visited Sarah as he had said, and Yahweh did to Sarah\\nas he had spoken.\\nSarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age,\\nat the set time of which God had spoken to him.\\nAbraham called his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore\\nto him, Isaac.\\nAbraham circumcised his son, Isaac, when he was eight days old,\\nas God had commanded him.\\nAbraham was one hundred years old when his son, Isaac,\\nwas born to him.\\nSarah said, \"God has made me laugh.  Everyone who hears will\\nlaugh with me.\"\\nShe said, \"Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah would\\nnurse children?  For I have borne him a son in his old age.\"\\nThe child grew, and was weaned.  Abraham made a great feast\\non the day that Isaac was weaned.\\nSarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne\\nto Abraham, mocking.\\nTherefore she said to Abraham, \"Cast out this handmaid and her son!\\nFor the son of this handmaid will not be heir with my son, Isaac.\"\\nThe thing was very grievous in Abraham\\'s sight on account\\nof his son.\\nGod said to Abraham, \"Don\\'t let it be grievous in your\\nsight because of the boy, and because of your handmaid.\\nIn all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice.\\nFor from Isaac will your seed be called.\\nI will also make a nation of the son of the handmaid,\\nbecause he is your seed.\"\\nAbraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle\\nof water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder;\\nand gave her the child, and sent her away.  She departed,\\nand wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.\\nThe water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child\\nunder one of the shrubs.\\nShe went and sat down opposite him, a good way off, about a bow\\nshot away.  For she said, \"Don\\'t let me see the death of the child.\"\\nShe sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.\\nGod heard the voice of the boy.  The angel of God called\\nto Hagar out of the sky, and said to her, \"What ails\\nyou, Hagar?  Don\\'t be afraid.  For God has heard the voice\\nof the boy where he is.\\nGet up, lift up the boy, and hold him in your hand.\\nFor I will make him a great nation.\"\\nGod opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water.  She went,\\nfilled the bottle with water, and gave the boy drink.\\nGod was with the boy, and he grew.  He lived in the wilderness,\\nand became, as he grew up, an archer.\\nHe lived in the wilderness of Paran.  His mother took a wife\\nfor him out of the land of Egypt.\\nIt happened at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain\\nof his army spoke to Abraham, saying, \"God is with you in all\\nthat you do.\\nNow, therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal\\nfalsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son\\'s son.\\nBut according to the kindness that I have done to you,\\nyou shall do to me, and to the land in which you have lived\\nas a foreigner.\"\\nAbraham said, \"I will swear.\"\\nAbraham complained to Abimelech because of a water well,\\nwhich Abimelech\\'s servants had violently taken away.\\nAbimelech said, \"I don\\'t know who has done this thing.\\nNeither did you tell me, neither did I hear of it, until today.\"\\nAbraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech.\\nThose two made a covenant.\\nAbraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.\\nAbimelech said to Abraham, \"What do these seven ewe lambs\\nwhich you have set by themselves mean?\"\\nHe said, \"You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand,\\nthat it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well.\"\\nTherefore he called that place Beersheba, because they\\nboth swore there.\\nSo they made a covenant at Beersheba.  Abimelech rose up\\nwith Phicol, the captain of his army, and they returned\\ninto the land of the Philistines.\\nAbraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and called there\\non the name of Yahweh, the Everlasting God.\\nAbraham lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines\\nmany days.\\nIt happened after these things, that God tested Abraham,\\nand said to him, \"Abraham!\"  He said, \"Here I am.\"\\nHe said, \"Now take your son, your only son, whom you love,\\neven Isaac, and go into the land of Moriah.  Offer him there\\nfor a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will\\ntell you of.\"\\nAbraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey,\\nand took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son.\\nHe split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up,\\nand went to the place of which God had told him.\\nOn the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw\\nthe place far off.\\nAbraham said to his young men, \"Stay here with the donkey.\\nThe boy and I will go yonder.  We will worship, and come\\nback to you.\"\\nAbraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on\\nIsaac his son.  He took in his hand the fire and the knife.\\nThey both went together.\\nIsaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, \"My father?\"\\nHe said, \"Here I am, my son.\"  He said, \"Here is the fire\\nand the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?\"\\nAbraham said, \"God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering,\\nmy son.\"  So they both went together.\\nThey came to the place which God had told him of.\\nAbraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order,\\nbound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on the wood.\\nAbraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to\\nkill his son.\\nThe angel of Yahweh called to him out of the sky, and said,\\n\"Abraham, Abraham!\"  He said, \"Here I am.\"\\nHe said, \"Don\\'t lay your hand on the boy, neither do anything to him.\\nFor now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld\\nyour son, your only son, from me.\"\\nAbraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind\\nhim was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns.\\nAbraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt\\noffering instead of his son.\\nAbraham called the name of that place Yahweh Will Provide.\\nAs it is said to this day,\\n\"On Yahweh\\'s mountain, it will be provided.\"\\nThe angel of Yahweh called to Abraham a second time out\\nof the sky,\\nand said, \"I have sworn by myself, says Yahweh, because you\\nhave done this thing, and have not withheld your son,\\nyour only son,\\nthat I will bless you greatly, and I will multiply your seed\\ngreatly like the stars of the heavens, and like the sand\\nwhich is on the seashore.  Your seed will possess the gate\\nof his enemies.\\nIn your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed,\\nbecause you have obeyed my voice.\"\\nSo Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went\\ntogether to Beersheba.  Abraham lived at Beersheba.\\nIt happened after these things, that it was told Abraham,\\nsaying, \"Behold, Milcah, she also has borne children to\\nyour brother Nahor:\\nUz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,\\nChesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.\"\\nBethuel became the father of Rebekah.  These eight Milcah bore\\nto Nahor, Abraham\\'s brother.\\nHis concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore\\nTebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.\\nSarah lived one hundred twenty-seven years.  This was the length\\nof Sarah\\'s life.\\nSarah died in Kiriath Arba (the same is Hebron), in the land\\nof Canaan.  Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.\\nAbraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke to the children\\nof Heth, saying,\\n\"I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you.\\nGive me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I\\nmay bury my dead out of my sight.\"\\nThe children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,\\n\"Hear us, my lord.  You are a prince of God among us.\\nBury your dead in the best of our tombs.  None of us will\\nwithhold from you his tomb.  Bury your dead.\"\\nAbraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land,\\neven to the children of Heth.\\nHe talked with them, saying, \"If it be your mind that I should\\nbury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me\\nto Ephron the son of Zohar,\\nthat he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has,\\nwhich is in the end of his field.  For the full price let him\\ngive it to me among you for a possession of a burying-place.\"\\nNow Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth.\\nEphron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of\\nthe children of Heth, even of all who went in at the gate\\nof his city, saying,\\n\"No, my lord, hear me.  I give you the field, and I give you\\nthe cave that is in it.  In the presence of the children\\nof my people I give it to you.  Bury your dead.\"\\nAbraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.\\nHe spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of\\nthe land, saying, \"But if you will, please hear me.\\nI will give the price of the field.  Take it from me,\\nand I will bury my dead there.\"\\nEphron answered Abraham, saying to him,\\n\"My lord, listen to me.  What is a piece of land worth\\nfour hundred shekels of silver between me and you?\\nTherefore bury your dead.\"\\nAbraham listened to Ephron.  Abraham weighed to Ephron\\nthe silver which he had named in the audience of the children\\nof Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the\\ncurrent merchants\\' standard.\\nSo the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was\\nbefore Mamre, the field, the cave which was in it,\\nand all the trees that were in the field, that were in all\\nof its borders, were deeded\\nto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children\\nof Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.\\nAfter this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave\\nof the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that is, Hebron),\\nin the land of Canaan.\\nThe field, and the cave that is in it, were deeded to Abraham\\nfor a possession of a burying place by the children of Heth.\\nAbraham was old, and well stricken in age.  Yahweh had blessed\\nAbraham in all things.\\nAbraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled\\nover all that he had, \"Please put your hand under my thigh.\\nI will make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and the God\\nof the earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son\\nof the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live.\\nBut you shall go to my country, and to my relatives, and take\\na wife for my son Isaac.\"\\nThe servant said to him, \"What if the woman isn\\'t willing\\nto follow me to this land?  Must I bring your son again\\nto the land you came from?\"\\nAbraham said to him, \"Beware that you don\\'t bring my\\nson there again.\\nYahweh, the God of heaven, who took me from my father\\'s house,\\nand from the land of my birth, who spoke to me, and who swore\\nto me, saying, \\'I will give this land to your seed.\\'\\nHe will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife\\nfor my son from there.\\nIf the woman isn\\'t willing to follow you, then you shall\\nbe clear from this my oath.  Only you shall not bring my\\nson there again.\"\\nThe servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master,\\nand swore to him concerning this matter.\\nThe servant took ten camels, of his master\\'s camels, and departed,\\nhaving a variety of good things of his master\\'s with him.\\nHe arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.\\nHe made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well\\nof water at the time of evening, the time that women go out\\nto draw water.\\nHe said, \"Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, please give me\\nsuccess this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.\\nBehold, I am standing by the spring of water.  The daughters\\nof the men of the city are coming out to draw water.\\nLet it happen, that the young lady to whom I will say,\\n\\'Please let down your pitcher, that I may drink,\\' and she\\nwill say, \\'Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink,\\'--\\nlet her be the one you have appointed for your servant Isaac.\\nBy this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.\"\\nIt happened, before he had finished speaking, that behold,\\nRebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah,\\nthe wife of Nahor, Abraham\\'s brother, with her pitcher\\non her shoulder.\\nThe young lady was very beautiful to look at, a virgin,\\nneither had any man known her.  She went down to the spring,\\nfilled her pitcher, and came up.\\nThe servant ran to meet her, and said, \"Please give me a drink,\\na little water from your pitcher.\"\\nShe said, \"Drink, my lord.\"  She hurried, and let down her\\npitcher on her hand, and gave him drink.\\nWhen she had done giving him drink, she said, \"I will also draw\\nfor your camels, until they have done drinking.\"\\nShe hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran\\nagain to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.\\nThe man looked steadfastly at her, remaining silent, to know\\nwhether Yahweh had made his journey prosperous or not.\\nIt happened, as the camels had done drinking, that the man\\ntook a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets\\nfor her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,\\nand said, \"Whose daughter are you?  Please tell me.\\nIs there room in your father\\'s house for us to lodge in?\"\\nShe said to him, \"I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah,\\nwhom she bore to Nahor.\"\\nShe said moreover to him, \"We have both straw and provender enough,\\nand room to lodge in.\"\\nThe man bowed his head, and worshiped Yahweh.\\nHe said, \"Blessed be Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who has\\nnot forsaken his loving kindness and his truth toward my master.\\nAs for me, Yahweh has led me in the way to the house of\\nmy master\\'s relatives.\"\\nThe young lady ran, and told her mother\\'s house about these words.\\nRebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban.  Laban ran\\nout to the man, to the spring.\\nIt happened, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his\\nsister\\'s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah\\nhis sister, saying, \"This is what the man said to me,\"\\nthat he came to the man.  Behold, he was standing by the camels\\nat the spring.\\nHe said, \"Come in, you blessed of Yahweh.  Why do you stand outside?\\nFor I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.\"\\nThe man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels.\\nHe gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash\\nhis feet and the feet of the men who were with him.\\nFood was set before him to eat, but he said, \"I will not eat\\nuntil I have told my message.\"  He said, \"Speak on.\"\\nHe said, \"I am Abraham\\'s servant.\\nYahweh has blessed my master greatly.  He has become great.\\nHe has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold,\\nmale servants and female servants, and camels and donkeys.\\nSarah, my master\\'s wife, bore a son to my master when she was old.\\nHe has given all that he has to him.\\nMy master made me swear, saying, \\'You shall not take a wife\\nfor my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose\\nland I live,\\nbut you shall go to my father\\'s house, and to my relatives,\\nand take a wife for my son.\\'\\nI said to my master, \\'What if the woman will not follow me?\\'\\nHe said to me, \\'Yahweh, before whom I walk, will send his\\nangel with you, and prosper your way.

Let it happen,\\nthat the maiden who comes forth to draw, to whom I will say,\\n\"Give me, I pray you, a little water from your pitcher to drink,\"\\nand she will tell me, \"Drink, and I will also draw for\\nyour camels,\"--let her be the woman whom Yahweh has appointed\\nfor my master\\'s son.\\'\\nBefore I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth\\nwith her pitcher on her shoulder.  She went down to the spring,\\nand drew.  I said to her, \\'Please let me drink.\\'\\nShe hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder,\\nand said, \\'Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.\\'\\nSo I drank, and she made the camels drink also.\\nI asked her, and said, \\'Whose daughter are you?\\'  She said,\\n\\'The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor\\'s son, whom Milcah bore to him.\\'\\nI put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands.\\nI bowed my head, and worshiped Yahweh, and blessed Yahweh,\\nthe God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way\\nto take my master\\'s brother\\'s daughter for his son.\\nNow if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me.\\nIf not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand,\\nor to the left.\"\\nThen Laban and Bethuel answered, \"The thing proceeds from Yahweh.\\nWe can\\'t speak to you bad or good.\\nBehold, Rebekah is before you.  Take her, and go, and let\\nher be your master\\'s son\\'s wife, as Yahweh has spoken.\"\\nIt happened that when Abraham\\'s servant heard their words,\\nhe bowed himself down to the earth to Yahweh.\\nThe servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,\\nand clothing, and gave them to Rebekah.  He also gave precious\\nthings to her brother and her mother.\\nThey ate and drank, he and the men who were with him,\\nand stayed all night.  They rose up in the morning, and he said,\\n\"Send me away to my master.\"\\nHer brother and her mother said, \"Let the young lady stay\\nwith us a few days, at least ten.  After that she will go.\"\\nHe said to them, \"Don\\'t hinder me, seeing Yahweh has prospered\\nmy way.  Send me away that I may go to my master.\"\\nThey said, \"We will call the young lady, and ask her.\"\\nThey called Rebekah, and said to her, \"Will you go with this man?\"\\nShe said, \"I will go.\"\\nThey sent away Rebekah, their sister, with her nurse,\\nAbraham\\'s servant, and his men.\\nThey blessed Rebekah, and said to her, \"Our sister, may you\\nbe the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let your seed\\npossess the gate of those who hate them.\"\\nRebekah arose with her ladies.  They rode on the camels,\\nand followed the man.

He ate and drank,\\nrose up, and went his way.  So Esau despised his birthright.\\nThere was a famine in the land, besides the first famine\\nthat was in the days of Abraham.  Isaac went to Abimelech\\nking of the Philistines, to Gerar.\\nYahweh appeared to him, and said, \"Don\\'t go down into Egypt.\\nLive in the land I will tell you about.\\nSojourn in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you.\\nFor to you, and to your seed, I will give all these lands, and I\\nwill establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.\\nI will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and will\\ngive to your seed all these lands.  In your seed will all\\nthe nations of the earth be blessed,\\nbecause Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge,\\nmy commandments, my statutes, and my laws.\"\\nIsaac lived in Gerar.\\nThe men of the place asked him about his wife.  He said,\\n\"She is my sister,\" for he was afraid to say, \"My wife,\"\\nlest, he thought, \"the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah,\\nbecause she is beautiful to look at.\"\\nIt happened, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech\\nking of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw,\\nand, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife.\\nAbimelech called Isaac, and said, \"Behold, surely she is your wife.\\nWhy did you say, \\'She is my sister?\\'\"  Isaac said to him,\\n\"Because I said, \\'Lest I die because of her.\\'\"\\nAbimelech said, \"What is this you have done to us?\\nOne of the people might easily have lain with your wife,\\nand you would have brought guilt on us!\"\\nAbimelech charged all the people, saying, \"He who touches this\\nman or his wife will surely be put to death.\"\\nIsaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one\\nhundred times what he planted.  Yahweh blessed him.\\nThe man grew great, and grew more and more until he\\nbecame very great.\\nHe had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds,\\nand a great household.  The Philistines envied him.\\nNow all the wells which his father\\'s servants had dug in\\nthe days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped,\\nand filled with earth.\\nAbimelech said to Isaac, \"Go from us, for you are much\\nmightier than we.\"\\nIsaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar,\\nand lived there.\\nIsaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days\\nof Abraham his father.  For the Philistines had stopped them\\nafter the death of Abraham.  He called their names after\\nthe names by which his father had called them.\\nIsaac\\'s servants dug in the valley, and found there a well\\nof springing water.\\nThe herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac\\'s herdsmen, saying,\\n\"The water is ours.\"  He called the name of the well Esek,\\nbecause they contended with him.\\nThey dug another well, and they argued over that, also.\\nHe called the name of it Sitnah.\\nHe left that place, and dug another well.  They didn\\'t\\nargue over that one.  He called it Rehoboth.  He said,\\n\"For now Yahweh has made room for us, and we will be fruitful\\nin the land.\"\\nHe went up from there to Beersheba.\\nYahweh appeared to him the same night, and said, \"I am\\nthe God of Abraham your father.  Don\\'t be afraid, for I am\\nwith you, and will bless you, and multiply your seed for my\\nservant Abraham\\'s sake.\"\\nHe built an altar there, and called on the name of Yahweh,\\nand pitched his tent there.  There Isaac\\'s servants dug a well.\\nThen Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend,\\nand Phicol the captain of his army.\\nIsaac said to them, \"Why have you come to me, since you hate me,\\nand have sent me away from you?\"\\nThey said, \"We saw plainly that Yahweh was with you.\\nWe said, \\'Let there now be an oath between us, even between us\\nand you, and let us make a covenant with you,\\nthat you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you,\\nand as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent\\nyou away in peace.\\'  You are now the blessed of Yahweh.\"\\nHe made them a feast, and they ate and drank.\\nThey rose up some time in the morning, and swore one to another.\\nIsaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.\\nIt happened the same day, that Isaac\\'s servants came, and told\\nhim concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him,\\n\"We have found water.\"\\nHe called it Shibah. Therefore\\nthe name of the city is Beersheba to this day.\\nWhen Esau was forty years old, he took as wife Judith,\\nthe daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter\\nof Elon the Hittite.\\nThey grieved Isaac\\'s and Rebekah\\'s spirits.\\nIt happened, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim,\\nso that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son,\\nand said to him, \"My son?\"  He said to him, \"Here I am.\"\\nHe said, \"See now, I am old.  I don\\'t know the day of my death.\\nNow therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow,\\nand go out to the field, and take me venison.\\nMake me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me,\\nthat I may eat, and that my soul may bless you before I die.\"\\nRebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son.\\nEsau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.\\nRebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, \"Behold, I heard\\nyour father speak to Esau your brother, saying,\\n\\'Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat,\\nand bless you before Yahweh before my death.\\'\\nNow therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which\\nI command you.\\nGo now to the flock, and get me from there two good kids\\nof the goats.  I will make them savory food for your father,\\nsuch as he loves.\\nYou shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that\\nhe may bless you before his death.\"\\nJacob said to Rebekah his mother, \"Behold, Esau my brother\\nis a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.\\nWhat if my father touches me?  I will seem to him as a deceiver,\\nand I would bring a curse on myself, and not a blessing.\"\\nHis mother said to him, \"Let your curse be on me, my son.\\nOnly obey my voice, and go get them for me.\"\\nHe went, and got them, and brought them to his mother.\\nHis mother made savory food, such as his father loved.\\nRebekah took the good clothes of Esau, her elder son,\\nwhich were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob,\\nher younger son.\\nShe put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands,\\nand on the smooth of his neck.\\nShe gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared,\\ninto the hand of her son Jacob.\\nHe came to his father, and said, \"My father?\"  He said, \"Here I am.\\nWho are you, my son?\"\\nJacob said to his father, \"I am Esau your firstborn.\\nI have done what you asked me to do.  Please arise, sit and eat\\nof my venison, that your soul may bless me.\"\\nIsaac said to his son, \"How is it that you have found it so quickly,\\nmy son?\"  He said, \"Because Yahweh your God gave me success.\"\\nIsaac said to Jacob, \"Please come near, that I may feel you,\\nmy son, whether you are really my son Esau or not.\"\\nJacob went near to Isaac his father.  He felt him, and said,\\n\"The voice is Jacob\\'s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.\"\\nHe didn\\'t recognize him, because his hands were hairy,\\nlike his brother, Esau\\'s hands.  So he blessed him.\\nHe said, \"Are you really my son Esau?\"  He said, \"I am.\"\\nHe said, \"Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son\\'s venison,\\nthat my soul may bless you.\"  He brought it near to him, and he ate.\\nHe brought him wine, and he drank.\\nHis father Isaac said to him, \"Come near now, and kiss me, my son.\"\\nHe came near, and kissed him.  He smelled the smell of his clothing,\\nand blessed him, and said, \"Behold, the smell of my son\\nis as the smell of a field which Yahweh has blessed.\\nGod give you of the dew of the sky, of the fatness of the earth,\\nand plenty of grain and new wine.\\nLet peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you.\\nBe lord over your brothers.  Let your mother\\'s sons\\nbow down to you.  Cursed be everyone who curses you.\\nBlessed be everyone who blesses you.\"\\nIt happened, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob,\\nand Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father,\\nthat Esau his brother came in from his hunting.\\nHe also made savory food, and brought it to his father.\\nHe said to his father, \"Let my father arise, and eat of his\\nson\\'s venison, that your soul may bless me.\"\\nIsaac his father said to him, \"Who are you?\"  He said,\\n\"I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.\"\\nIsaac trembled violently, and said, \"Who, then, is he who has\\ntaken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before\\nyou came, and have blessed him?  Yes, he will be blessed.\"\\nWhen Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an\\nexceeding great and bitter cry, and said to his father,\\n\"Bless me, even me also, my father.\"\\nHe said, \"Your brother came with deceit, and has taken\\naway your blessing.\"\\nHe said, \"Isn\\'t he rightly named Jacob?  For he has\\nsupplanted me these two times.  He took away my birthright.\\nSee, now he has taken away my blessing.\"  He said, \"Haven\\'t you\\nreserved a blessing for me?\"\\nIsaac answered Esau, \"Behold, I have made him your lord,\\nand all his brothers have I given to him for servants.\\nWith grain and new wine have I sustained him.  What then\\nwill I do for you, my son?\"\\nEsau said to his father, \"Have you but one blessing, my father?\\nBless me, even me also, my father.\"  Esau lifted up\\nhis voice, and wept.\\nIsaac his father answered him, \"Behold, of the fatness of the earth\\nwill be your dwelling, and of the dew of the sky from above.\\nBy your sword will you live, and you will serve your brother.\\nIt will happen, when you will break loose, that you shall\\nshake his yoke from off your neck.\"\\nEsau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father\\nblessed him.  Esau said in his heart, \"The days of mourning\\nfor my father are at hand.  Then I will kill my brother Jacob.\"\\nThe words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah.\\nShe sent and called Jacob, her younger son, and said\\nto him, \"Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you\\nby planning to kill you.\\nNow therefore, my son, obey my voice.  Arise, flee to Laban,\\nmy brother, in Haran.\\nStay with him a few days, until your brother\\'s fury turns away;\\nuntil your brother\\'s anger turn away from you, and he forgets what\\nyou have done to him.  Then I will send, and get you from there.\\nWhy should I be bereaved of you both in one day?\"\\nRebekah said to Isaac, \"I am weary of my life because of\\nthe daughters of Heth.  If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters\\nof Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land,\\nwhat good will my life do me?\"\\nIsaac called Jacob, blessed him, and commanded him, \"You shall\\nnot take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.\\nArise, go to Paddan Aram, to the house of Bethuel your\\nmother\\'s father.  Take a wife from there from the daughters\\nof Laban, your mother\\'s brother.\\nMay God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you,\\nthat you may be a company of peoples,\\nand give you the blessing of Abraham, to you, and to your seed\\nwith you, that you may inherit the land where you travel,\\nwhich God gave to Abraham.\"\\nIsaac sent Jacob away.  He went to Paddan Aram to Laban, son of\\nBethuel the Syrian, Rebekah\\'s brother, Jacob\\'s and Esau\\'s mother.\\nNow Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away\\nto Paddan Aram, to take him a wife from there, and that as\\nhe blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, \"You shall not\\ntake a wife of the daughters of Canaan,\"\\nand that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone\\nto Paddan Aram.\\nEsau saw that the daughters of Canaan didn\\'t please Isaac,\\nhis father.\\nEsau went to Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had,\\nMahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham\\'s son, the sister\\nof Nebaioth, to be his wife.\\nJacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.\\nHe came to a certain place, and stayed there all night,\\nbecause the sun had set.  He took one of the stones of the place,\\nand put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.\\nHe dreamed.  Behold, a stairway set upon the earth, and the top\\nof it reached to heaven.  Behold, the angels of God ascending\\nand descending on it.\\nBehold, Yahweh stood above it, and said, \"I am Yahweh,\\nthe God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac.\\nThe land whereon you lie, to you will I give it, and to your seed.\\nYour seed will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread\\nabroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north,\\nand to the south.  In you and in your seed will all the families\\nof the earth be blessed.\\nBehold, I am with you, and will keep you, wherever you go,\\nand will bring you again into this land.  For I will not leave you,\\nuntil I have done that which I have spoken of to you.\"\\nJacob awakened out of his sleep, and he said, \"Surely Yahweh\\nis in this place, and I didn\\'t know it.\"\\nHe was afraid, and said, \"How dreadful is this place!\\nThis is none other than God\\'s house, and this is the\\ngate of heaven.\"\\nJacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone\\nthat he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar,\\nand poured oil on the top of it.\\nHe called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city\\nwas Luz at the first.\\nJacob vowed a vow, saying, \"If God will be with me, and will\\nkeep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat,\\nand clothing to put on,\\nso that I come again to my father\\'s house in peace, and Yahweh\\nwill be my God,\\nthen this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, will be\\nGod\\'s house.  Of all that you will give me I will surely give\\nthe tenth to you.\"\\nThen Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of\\nthe children of the east.\\nHe looked, and behold, a well in the field, and, behold, three flocks\\nof sheep lying there by it.  For out of that well they watered\\nthe flocks.  The stone on the well\\'s mouth was large.\\nThere all the flocks were gathered.  They rolled the stone\\nfrom the well\\'s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone\\nagain on the well\\'s mouth in its place.\\nJacob said to them, \"My relatives, where are you from?\"\\nThey said, \"We are from Haran.\"\\nHe said to them, \"Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?\"  They said,\\n\"We know him.\"\\nHe said to them, \"Is it well with him?\"  They said, \"It is well.\\nSee, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep.\"\\nHe said, \"Behold, it is still the middle of the day,\\nnot time to gather the livestock together.  Water the sheep,\\nand go and feed them.\"\\nThey said, \"We can\\'t, until all the flocks are gathered\\ntogether, and they roll the stone from the well\\'s mouth.\\nThen we water the sheep.\"\\nWhile he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her\\nfather\\'s sheep, for she kept them.\\nIt happened, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban,\\nhis mother\\'s brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother\\'s brother,\\nthat Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well\\'s mouth,\\nand watered the flock of Laban his mother\\'s brother.\\nJacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.\\nJacob told Rachel that he was her father\\'s brother, and that\\nhe was Rebekah\\'s son.  She ran and told her father.\\nIt happened, when Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister\\'s son,\\nthat he ran to meet Jacob, and embraced him, and kissed him,\\nand brought him to his house.  Jacob told Laban all these things.\\nLaban said to him, Surely you are my bone and my flesh.\\nHe lived with him for a month.\\nLaban said to Jacob, \"Because you are my brother, should you\\ntherefore serve me for nothing?  Tell me, what will\\nyour wages be?\"\\nLaban had two daughters.  The name of the elder was Leah,\\nand the name of the younger was Rachel.\\nLeah\\'s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in\\nform and attractive.\\nJacob loved Rachel.  He said, \"I will serve you seven years\\nfor Rachel, your younger daughter.\"\\nLaban said, \"It is better that I give her to you, than that I\\nshould give her to another man.  Stay with me.\"\\nJacob served seven years for Rachel.  They seemed to him\\nbut a few days, for the love he had for her.\\nJacob said to Laban, \"Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled,\\nthat I may go in to her.\"\\nLaban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.\\nIt happened in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter,\\nand brought her to him.  He went in to her.\\nLaban gave Zilpah his handmaid to his daughter Leah for a handmaid.\\nIt happened in the morning that, behold, it was Leah.\\nHe said to Laban, \"What is this you have done to me?\\nDidn\\'t I serve with you for Rachel?  Why then have\\nyou deceived me?\"\\nLaban said, \"It is not done so in our place, to give the younger\\nbefore the firstborn.\\nFulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other\\nalso for the service which you will serve with me yet\\nseven other years.\"\\nJacob did so, and fulfilled her week.  He gave him Rachel\\nhis daughter as wife.\\nLaban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah, his handmaid,\\nto be her handmaid.\\nHe went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah,\\nand served with him yet seven other years.\\nYahweh saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb,\\nbut Rachel was barren.\\nLeah conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben.\\nFor she said, \"Because Yahweh has looked at my affliction.\\nFor now my husband will love me.\"\\nShe conceived again, and bore a son, and said, \"Because Yahweh has\\nheard that I am hated, he has therefore given me this son also.\"\\nShe named him Simeon.\\nShe conceived again, and bore a son.  Said, \"Now this time will my\\nhusband be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons.\"\\nTherefore was his name called Levi.\\nShe conceived again, and bore a son.  She said, \"This time\\nwill I praise Yahweh.\"  Therefore she named him Judah.\\nThen she stopped bearing.\\nWhen Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied\\nher sister.  She said to Jacob, \"Give me children, or else\\nI will die.\"\\nJacob\\'s anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said,\\n\"Am I in God\\'s place, who has withheld from you the fruit\\nof the womb?\"\\nShe said, \"Behold, my maid Bilhah.  Go in to her, that she\\nmay bear on my knees, and I also may obtain children by her.\"\\nShe gave him Bilhah her handmaid as wife, and Jacob went\\nin to her.\\nBilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son.\\nRachel said, \"God has judged me, and has also heard my voice,\\nand has given me a son.\"  Therefore called she his name Dan.\\nBilhah, Rachel\\'s handmaid, conceived again, and bore Jacob\\na second son.\\nRachel said, \"With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister,\\nand have prevailed.\"  She named him Naphtali.\\nWhen Leah saw that she had finished bearing, she took Zilpah,\\nher handmaid, and gave her to Jacob as a wife.\\nZilpah, Leah\\'s handmaid, bore Jacob a son.\\nLeah said, \"How fortunate!\"  She named him Gad.\\nZilpah, Leah\\'s handmaid, bore Jacob a second son.\\nLeah said, \"Happy am I, for the daughters will call me happy.\"\\nShe named him Asher.\\nReuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes\\nin the field, and brought them to his mother, Leah.  Then Rachel\\nsaid to Leah, \"Please give me some of your son\\'s mandrakes.\"\\nShe said to her, \"Is it a small matter that you have taken away\\nmy husband?  Would you take away my son\\'s mandrakes, also?\"\\nRachel said, \"Therefore he will lie with you tonight for\\nyour son\\'s mandrakes.\"\\nJacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went\\nout to meet him, and said, \"You must come in to me;\\nfor I have surely hired you with my son\\'s mandrakes.\"\\nHe lay with her that night.\\nGod listened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob\\na fifth son.\\nLeah said, \"God has given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid\\nto my husband.\"  She named him Issachar.\\nLeah conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob.\\nLeah said, \"God has endowed me with a good dowry.

Yahweh has blessed you wherever I turned.\\nNow when will I provide for my own house also?\"\\nHe said, \"What shall I give you?\"  Jacob said, \"You shall\\nnot give me anything.  If you will do this thing for me,\\nI will again feed your flock and keep it.\\nI will pass through all your flock today, removing from there\\nevery speckled and spotted one, and every black one among\\nthe sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats.\\nThis will be my hire.\\nSo my righteousness will answer for me hereafter,\\nwhen you come concerning my hire that is before you.\\nEvery one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats,\\nand black among the sheep, that might be with me,\\nwill be counted stolen.\"\\nLaban said, \"Behold, I desire it to be according to your word.\"\\nThat day, he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted,\\nand all the female goats that were speckled and spotted,\\nevery one that had white in it, and all the black ones among\\nthe sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.\\nHe set three days\\' journey between himself and Jacob,\\nand Jacob fed the rest of Laban\\'s flocks.\\nJacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar, almond, plane tree,\\npeeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear\\nwhich was in the rods.\\nHe set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the\\ngutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink.\\nThey conceived when they came to drink.\\nThe flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought\\nforth streaked, speckled, and spotted.\\nJacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks\\ntoward the streaked and all the black in the flock of Laban:\\nand he put his own droves apart, and didn\\'t put them\\ninto Laban\\'s flock.\\nIt happened, whenever the stronger of the flock conceived,\\nthat Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock\\nin the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;\\nbut when the flock were feeble, he didn\\'t put them in.\\nSo the feebler were Laban\\'s, and the stronger Jacob\\'s.\\nThe man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks,\\nfemale servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.\\nHe heard the words of Laban\\'s sons, saying, \"Jacob has taken away\\nall that was our father\\'s. From that which was our father\\'s,\\nhas he gotten all this wealth.\"\\nJacob saw the expression on Laban\\'s face, and, behold, it was\\nnot toward him as before.\\nYahweh said to Jacob, \"Return to the land of your fathers,\\nand to your relatives, and I will be with you.\"\\nJacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock,\\nand said to them, \"I see the expression on your father\\'s face,\\nthat it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father\\nhas been with me.\\nYou know that I have served your father with all of my strength.\\nYour father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times,\\nbut God didn\\'t allow him to hurt me.\\nIf he said this, \\'The speckled will be your wages,\\' then all\\nthe flock bore speckled.  If he said this, \\'The streaked\\nwill be your wages,\\' then all the flock bore streaked.\\nThus God has taken away your father\\'s livestock, and given\\nthem to me.\\nIt happened during mating season that I lifted up my eyes,\\nand saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which leaped\\non the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled.\\nThe angel of God said to me in the dream, \\'Jacob,\\' and I said,\\n\\'Here I am.\\'\\nHe said, \\'Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats\\nwhich leap on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled,\\nfor I have seen all that Laban does to you.\\nI am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you\\nvowed a vow to me.

For he has sold us,\\nand has also quite devoured our money.\\nFor all the riches which God has taken away from our father,\\nthat is ours and our children\\'s. Now then, whatever God has\\nsaid to you, do.\"\\nThen Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels,\\nand he took away all his livestock, and all his possessions\\nwhich he had gathered, including the livestock which\\nhe had gained in Paddan Aram, to go to Isaac his father,\\nto the land of Canaan.\\nNow Laban had gone to shear his sheep:  and Rachel stole\\nthe teraphim that were her father\\'s.\\nJacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he didn\\'t tell him\\nthat he was running away.\\nSo he fled with all that he had.  He rose up, passed over the River,\\nand set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.\\nLaban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled.\\nHe took his relatives with him, and pursued after him\\nseven days\\' journey.  He overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.\\nGod came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream of the night,\\nand said to him, \"Take heed to yourself that you don\\'t speak\\nto Jacob either good or bad.\"\\nLaban caught up with Jacob.  Now Jacob had pitched his tent\\nin the mountain, and Laban with his relatives encamped\\nin the mountain of Gilead.\\nLaban said to Jacob, \"What have you done, that you have deceived me,\\nand carried away my daughters like captives of the sword?\\nWhy did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and didn\\'t tell me,\\nthat I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs,\\nwith tambourine and with harp;\\nand didn\\'t allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters?\\nNow have you done foolishly.\\nIt is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your\\nfather spoke to me last night, saying, \\'Take heed to yourself\\nthat you don\\'t speak to Jacob either good or bad.\\'\\nNow, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your\\nfather\\'s house, but why have you stolen my gods?\"\\nJacob answered Laban, \"Because I was afraid, for I said,\\n\\'Lest you should take your daughters from me by force.\\'\\nAnyone you find your gods with shall not live.\\nBefore our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and take it.\"\\nFor Jacob didn\\'t know that Rachel had stolen them.\\nLaban went into Jacob\\'s tent, into Leah\\'s tent, and into\\nthe tent of the two female servants; but he didn\\'t find them.\\nHe went out of Leah\\'s tent, and entered into Rachel\\'s tent.\\nNow Rachel had taken the teraphim, put them in the camel\\'s\\nsaddle, and sat on them.  Laban felt about all the tent,\\nbut didn\\'t find them.\\nShe said to her father, \"Don\\'t let my lord be angry that I\\ncan\\'t rise up before you; for the manner of women is on me.\"\\nHe searched, but didn\\'t find the teraphim.\\nJacob was angry, and argued with Laban.  Jacob answered\\nLaban, \"What is my trespass?  What is my sin, that you have\\nhotly pursued after me?\\nNow that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found\\nof all your household stuff?  Set it here before my relatives\\nand your relatives, that they may judge between us two.\\nThese twenty years I have been with you.

Of my hand you required it,\\nwhether stolen by day or stolen by night.\\nThis was my situation:  in the day the drought consumed me,\\nand the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes.\\nThese twenty years I have been in your house.  I served you fourteen\\nyears for your two daughters, and six years for your flock,\\nand you have changed my wages ten times.\\nUnless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear\\nof Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me\\naway empty.  God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands,\\nand rebuked you last night.\"\\nLaban answered Jacob, \"The daughters are my daughters,\\nthe children are my children, the flocks are my flocks,\\nand all that you see is mine:  and what can I do this day to\\nthese my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?\\nNow come, let us make a covenant, you and I; and let it be\\nfor a witness between me and you.\"\\nJacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.\\nJacob said to his relatives, \"Gather stones.\"  They took stones,\\nand made a heap.  They ate there by the heap.\\nLaban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.\\nLaban said, \"This heap is witness between me and you this day.\"\\nTherefore it was named Galeed\\nand Mizpah, for he said, \"Yahweh watch between me and you,\\nwhen we are absent one from another.\\nIf you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives besides\\nmy daughters, no man is with us; behold, God is witness\\nbetween me and you.\"\\nLaban said to Jacob, \"See this heap, and see the pillar,\\nwhich I have set between me and you.\\nMay this heap be a witness, and the pillar be a witness,\\nthat I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you\\nwill not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.\\nThe God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father,\\njudge between us.\"  Then Jacob swore by the fear of\\nhis father, Isaac.\\nJacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his\\nrelatives to eat bread.  They ate bread, and stayed all night\\nin the mountain.\\nEarly in the morning, Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and\\nhis daughters, and blessed them.  Laban departed and returned\\nto his place.\\nJacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.\\nWhen he saw them, Jacob said, \"This is God\\'s army.\"\\nHe called the name of that place Mahanaim.\\nJacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother,\\nto the land of Seir, the field of Edom.\\nHe commanded them, saying, \"This is what you shall tell\\nmy lord, Esau:  \\'This is what your servant, Jacob, says.\\nI have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and stayed until now.\\nI have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants.\\nI have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.\\'\"\\nThe messengers returned to Jacob, saying, \"We came to your\\nbrother Esau.  Not only that, but he comes to meet you,\\nand four hundred men with him.\"\\nThen Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed.\\nHe divided the people who were with him, and the flocks,\\nand the herds, and the camels, into two companies;\\nand he said, \"If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it,\\nthen the company which is left will escape.\"\\nJacob said, \"God of my father Abraham, and God of my\\nfather Isaac, Yahweh, who said to me, \\'Return to your country,\\nand to your relatives, and I will do you good,\\'\\nI am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses,\\nand of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant;\\nfor with just my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I\\nhave become two companies.\\nPlease deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau:\\nfor I fear him, lest he come and strike me, and the mothers\\nwith the children.\\nYou said, \\'I will surely do you good, and make your seed\\nas the sand of the sea, which can\\'t be numbered because there\\nare so many.\\'\"\\nHe lodged there that night, and took from that which he had\\nwith him, a present for Esau, his brother:\\ntwo hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred\\newes and twenty rams,\\nthirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls,\\ntwenty female donkeys and ten foals.\\nHe delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd\\nby itself, and said to his servants, \"Pass over before me,\\nand put a space between herd and herd.\"\\nHe commanded the foremost, saying, \"When Esau, my brother, meets you,\\nand asks you, saying, \\'Whose are you?  Where are you going?\\nWhose are these before you?\\'\\nThen you shall say, \\'They are your servant, Jacob\\'s. It is a\\npresent sent to my lord, Esau.  Behold, he also is behind us.\\'\"\\nHe commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed\\nthe herds, saying, \"This is how you shall speak to Esau,\\nwhen you find him.\\nYou shall say, \\'Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob,\\nis behind us.\\'\"  For, he said, \"I will appease him with the present\\nthat goes before me, and afterward I will see his face.\\nPerhaps he will accept me.\"\\nSo the present passed over before him, and he himself lodged\\nthat night in the camp.\\nHe rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids,\\nand his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.\\nHe took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over\\nthat which he had.\\nJacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until\\nthe breaking of the day.\\nWhen he saw that he didn\\'t prevail against him, he touched\\nthe hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob\\'s thigh\\nwas strained, as he wrestled.\\nThe man said, \"Let me go, for the day breaks.\"  Jacob said,\\n\"I won\\'t let you go, unless you bless me.\"\\nHe said to him, \"What is your name?\"  He said, \"Jacob.\"\\nHe said, \"Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel;\\nfor you have fought with God and with men, and have prevailed.\"\\nJacob asked him, \"Please tell me your name.\"\\nHe said, \"Why is it that you ask what my name is?\"\\nHe blessed him there.\\nJacob called the name of the place Peniel:\\nfor, he said, \"I have seen God face to face,\\nand my life is preserved.\"\\nThe sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped\\nbecause of his thigh.\\nTherefore the children of Israel don\\'t eat the sinew of\\nthe hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day,\\nbecause he touched the hollow of Jacob\\'s thigh in the sinew\\nof the hip.\\nJacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming,\\nand with him four hundred men.  He divided the children\\nbetween Leah, Rachel, and the two handmaids.\\nHe put the handmaids and their children in front, Leah and her\\nchildren after, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear.\\nHe himself passed over in front of them, and bowed himself\\nto the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.\\nEsau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his neck, kissed him,\\nand they wept.\\nHe lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;\\nand said, \"Who are these with you?\"  He said, \"The children\\nwhom God has graciously given your servant.\"\\nThen the handmaids came near with their children,\\nand they bowed themselves.\\nLeah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves.\\nAfter them, Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed themselves.\\nEsau said, \"What do you mean by all this company which I met?\"\\nJacob said, \"To find favor in the sight of my lord.\"\\nEsau said, \"I have enough, my brother; let that which you\\nhave be yours.\"\\nJacob said, \"Please, no, if I have now found favor in your sight,\\nthen receive my present at my hand, because I have seen your face,\\nas one sees the face of God, and you were pleased with me.\\nPlease take the gift that I brought to you, because God has\\ndealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.\"\\nHe urged him, and he took it.\\nEsau said, \"Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I\\nwill go before you.\"\\nJacob said to him, \"My lord knows that the children are tender,\\nand that the flocks and herds with me have their young,\\nand if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.\\nPlease let my lord pass over before his servant, and I\\nwill lead on gently, according to the pace of the livestock\\nthat are before me and according to the pace of the children,\\nuntil I come to my lord to Seir.\"\\nEsau said, \"Let me now leave with you some of the folk who are\\nwith me.\"  He said, \"Why?  Let me find favor in the sight\\nof my lord.\"\\nSo Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.\\nJacob traveled to Succoth, built himself a house, and made\\nshelters for his livestock.  Therefore the name of the place\\nis called Succoth.\\nJacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is\\nin the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan Aram;\\nand encamped before the city.\\nHe bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent,\\nat the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem\\'s father,\\nfor one hundred pieces of money.\\nHe erected an altar there, and called it El Elohe Israel.\\nDinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob, went out\\nto see the daughters of the land.\\nShechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her.\\nHe took her, lay with her, and humbled her.\\nHis soul joined to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved\\nthe young lady, and spoke kindly to the young lady.\\nShechem spoke to his father, Hamor, saying, \"Get me this young\\nlady as a wife.\"\\nNow Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah, his daughter;\\nand his sons were with his livestock in the field.\\nJacob held his peace until they came.\\nHamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to talk with him.\\nThe sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it.\\nThe men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he\\nhad done folly in Israel in lying with Jacob\\'s daughter;\\na which thing ought not to be done.\\nHamor talked with them, saying, \"The soul of my son, Shechem,\\nlongs for your daughter.  Please give her to him as a wife.\\nMake marriages with us.  Give your daughters to us, and take\\nour daughters for yourselves.\\nYou shall dwell with us, and the land will be before you.\\nLive and trade in it, and get possessions in it.\"\\nShechem said to her father and to her brothers, \"Let me find\\nfavor in your eyes, and whatever you will tell me I will give.\\nAsk me a great amount for a dowry, and I will give whatever\\nyou ask of me, but give me the young lady as a wife.\"\\nThe sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit,\\nand spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,\\nand said to them, \"We can\\'t do this thing, to give our sister\\nto one who is uncircumcised; for that is a reproach to us.\\nOnly on this condition will we consent to you.  If you will\\nbe as we are, that every male of you be circumcised;\\nthen will we give our daughters to you, and we will take\\nyour daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we\\nwill become one people.\\nBut if you will not listen to us, to be circumcised, then we\\nwill take our sister, and we will be gone.\"\\nTheir words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor\\'s son.\\nThe young man didn\\'t wait to do this thing, because he had delight\\nin Jacob\\'s daughter, and he was honored above all the house\\nof his father.\\nHamor and Shechem, his son, came to the gate of their city,\\nand talked with the men of their city, saying,\\n\"These men are peaceful with us.

Olkoot ne teidän ravintonanne. \\nJa\\nvillieläimille ja taivaan linnuille ja kaikelle,\\nmikä maan päällä elää ja liikkuu, minä annan\\nravinnoksi vihreät kasvit.\" Niin tapahtui. \\nJa\\nJumala katsoi kaikkea tekemäänsä, ja kaikki oli\\nhyvää. Tuli ilta ja tuli aamu, näin meni kuudes\\npäivä.\\nNäin tulivat valmiiksi taivas ja maa ja kaikki\\nmitä niissä on. \\nJumala oli saanut työnsä\\npäätökseen, ja seitsemäntenä päivänä hän lepäsi\\nkaikesta työstään. \\nJa Jumala siunasi seitsemännen\\npäivän ja pyhitti sen, koska hän sinä päivänä lepäsi\\nkaikesta luomistyöstään. \\nTämä on kertomus siitä,\\nkuinka taivas ja maa saivat alkunsa silloin kun ne\\nluotiin.\\nSiihen aikaan, kun Herra Jumala teki maan ja\\ntaivaan, \\nei maan päällä ollut vielä yhtään\\npensasta eikä edes ruoho ollut noussut esiin, sillä\\nHerra Jumala ei ollut antanut sateen kastella maata\\neikä ihmistä vielä ollut maata viljelemässä.\\nMutta maasta kumpusi vettä, ja se kasteli maan\\npinnan. \\nJa Herra Jumala muovasi maan tomusta\\nihmisen ja puhalsi hänen sieraimiinsa elämän\\nhenkäyksen. Näin ihmisestä tuli elävä olento.\\nHerra Jumala istutti puutarhan itään, Eedeniin,\\nja sinne hän asetti ihmisen, jonka oli tehnyt.\\nHerra Jumala kasvatti maasta esiin kaikenlaisia\\npuita, jotka olivat kauniita katsella ja joiden\\nhedelmät olivat hyviä syödä, ja paratiisin keskelle\\nhän kasvatti elämän puun sekä hyvänja pahantiedon\\npuun.\\nEedenistä sai alkunsa joki, joka kasteli\\npuutarhan ja joka sieltä lähtiessään jakautui\\nneljäksi haaraksi. \\nEnsimmäisen nimi on Pison. Se\\nkiertää koko Havilan maan, missä on kultaa, \\nja\\nsen maan kulta on hyvää. Siellä on myös\\nsuitsutuspihkaa ja onykskiveä. \\nToisen joen nimi\\non Gihon. Se kiertää koko Nubian maan. \\nKolmannen\\njoen nimi on Tigris, ja se virtaa Assurin editse. Ja\\nneljäs joki on Eufrat.\\nHerra Jumala asetti ihmisen Eedenin puutarhaan\\nviljelemään ja varjelemaan sitä. \\nHerra Jumala\\nsanoi ihmiselle: \"Saat vapaasti syödä puutarhan\\nkaikista puista. \\nVain siitä puusta, joka antaa\\ntiedon hyvästä ja pahasta, älä syö, sillä sinä\\npäivänä, jona siitä syöt, olet kuoleman oma.\"\\nHerra Jumala sanoi: \"Ei ole hyvä ihmisen olla\\nyksinään. Minä teen hänelle kumppanin, joka sopii\\nhänen avukseen.\" \\nJa Herra Jumala muovasi maasta\\nkaikki villieläimet ja kaikki taivaan linnut ja vei\\nne ihmisen luo nähdäkseen, minkä nimen hän kullekin\\nantaisi. Ja jokainen elävä olento sai sen nimen,\\njolla ihminen sitä kutsui. \\nNäin ihminen antoi\\nnimet kaikille karjaeläimille, kaikille linnuille ja\\nkaikille villieläimille. Mutta ihmiselle ei löytynyt\\nsopivaa kumppania.\\nSilloin Herra Jumala vaivutti ihmisen syvään\\nuneen ja otti hänen nukkuessaan yhden hänen\\nkylkiluistaan ja täytti kohdan lihalla. \\nHerra\\nJumala teki tästä kylkiluusta naisen ja toi hänet\\nmiehen luo. \\nJa mies sanoi:\\n-- Tämä se on! Tämä on\\nluu minun luustani\\nja liha minun lihastani.\\nNaiseksi häntä sanottakoon:\\nmiehestä hänet on otettu.\\nSiksi mies jättää isänsä ja äitinsä ja liittyy\\nvaimoonsa, niin että he tulevat yhdeksi lihaksi.\\nJa he olivat molemmat alasti, mies ja hänen\\nvaimonsa, eivätkä he tunteneet häpeää.\\nHeprean kielessä maata merkitsevä sana adama ja ihmistä merkitsevä\\nsana adam ovat äänteellisesti lähellä toisiaan.

Se sanoi naiselle: \"Onko\\nJumala todella sanonut: \\'Te ette saa syödä mistään\\npuutarhan puusta\\'?\" \\nNainen vastasi käärmeelle:\\n\"Kyllä me saamme syödä puutarhan puiden hedelmiä.\\nVain siitä puusta, joka on keskellä paratiisia,\\nJumala on sanonut: \\'Älkää syökö sen hedelmiä, älkää\\nedes koskeko niihin, ettette kuolisi.\\'\" \\nSilloin\\nkäärme sanoi naiselle: \"Ei, ette te kuole. \\nMutta\\nJumala tietää, että niin pian kuin te syötte siitä,\\nteidän silmänne avautuvat ja teistä tulee Jumalan\\nkaltaisia, niin että tiedätte kaiken, sekä hyvän\\nettä pahan.\" \\nNainen näki nyt, että puun hedelmät\\nolivat hyviä syödä ja että se oli kaunis katsella ja\\nhoukutteleva, koska se antoi ymmärrystä. Hän otti\\nsiitä hedelmän ja söi ja antoi myös miehelleen, joka\\noli hänen kanssaan, ja mieskin söi.\\nSilloin heidän silmänsä avautuivat, ja he\\nhuomasivat olevansa alasti. He sitoivat yhteen\\nviikunanlehtiä ja kietoivat ne vyötärölleen.\\nKun iltapäivä viileni, he kuulivat Jumalan\\nkävelevän puutarhassa. Silloin mies ja nainen\\nmenivät Jumalaa piiloon puutarhan puiden sekaan.\\nHerra Jumala huusi miestä ja kysyi: \"Missä sinä\\nolet?\" \\nMies vastasi: \"Minä kuulin sinun\\naskeleesi puutarhassa.

Eeva sanoi: \"Minä olen\\nHerran avulla saanut poikalapsen.\"\\nSitten hän\\nsynnytti Kainille veljen, Abelin. Abelista tuli\\nlammaspaimen ja Kainista maanviljelijä.\\nKerran Kain toi Herralle uhrilahjaksi maan satoa,\\nja Abel toi lampaidensa esikoiskaritsoja ja\\nniiden rasvaa.

Silloin Kain suuttui kovin\\nja hänen katseensa synkistyi. \\nHerra kysyi\\nKainilta: \"Miksi sinä suutuit ja katselet synkkänä\\nmaahan? \\nJos teet oikein, voit kohottaa katseesi,\\nmutta jos et tee, on synti ovella vaanimassa. Sinua\\nse haluaa, mutta sinun on pidettävä se kurissa.\"\\nKain sanoi veljelleen Abelille: \"Lähde mukaani.\"\\nMutta kun he olivat kulkeneet jonkin matkaa, Kain\\nkävi veljensä Abelin kimppuun ja tappoi hänet.\\nSilloin Herra kysyi Kainilta: \"Missä on veljesi\\nAbel?\" Kain vastasi: \"En tiedä. Olenko minä veljeni\\nvartija?\" \\nHerra sanoi: \"Mitä oletkaan tehnyt!\\nEtkö kuule, kuinka veljesi veri huutaa minulle\\nmaasta? \\nNyt olet kirottu etkä voi jäädä tänne,\\nsillä tämän maan oli avattava suunsa ja otettava\\nvastaan veljesi veri, jonka sinä vuodatit. \\nKun\\nkoetat viljellä maata, se ei enää ruoki sinua, vaan\\nsinun on harhailtava kodittomana ja pakolaisena maan\\npäällä.\"\\nKain sanoi Herralle: \"Syntini rangaistus on\\nminulle liian raskas kantaa. \\nKun sinä nyt\\nkarkotat minut tältä seudulta, minä joudun pois\\nkasvojesi edestä.

Kain oli ensimmäinen, joka perusti\\nkaupungin, ja hän antoi sille nimen poikansa Henokin\\nmukaan. \\nHenokille syntyi Irad, Iradille syntyi\\nMehujael, Mehujaelille syntyi Metusael, ja\\nMetusaelille syntyi Lemek.\\nLemek otti itselleen kaksi vaimoa; toisen nimi\\noli Ada ja toisen Silla. \\nAda synnytti Jabalin,\\njosta tuli teltoissa asuvien paimentolaisten\\nkantaisä. \\nJabalin veli oli nimeltään Jubal, ja\\nhänestä tuli ensimmäinen harpunja huilunsoittaja.\\nMyös Silla synnytti pojan, Tubal-Kainin, sepän, joka aloitti pronssin\\nja raudan takomisen.

Siihen aikaan maassa asuivat\\nkanaanilaiset. \\nHerra ilmestyi Abramille ja sanoi:\\n\"Sinun jälkeläisillesi minä annan tämän maan.\" Ja\\nAbram rakensi sinne alttarin Herralle, joka oli\\nilmestynyt hänelle. \\nSieltä hän siirtyi Betelin\\nitäpuolen vuorille, ja hän pystytti telttansa niin,\\nettä Betel oli länsipuolella ja Ai itäpuolella. Hän\\nrakensi sinne alttarin ja rukoili Herraa. \\nSieltä\\nAbram siirtyi paikasta toiseen etelään Negeviin\\npäin.\\nSitten tuli maahan nälänhätä. Koska nälänhätä\\noli kova, Abram siirtyi Egyptiin ja asui siellä\\nmuukalaisena. \\nEgyptiä lähestyttäessä hän sanoi\\nvaimolleen Saraille: \"Minä tiedän, että sinä olet\\nkaunis nainen. \\nKun egyptiläiset näkevät sinut ja\\nkäsittävät, että sinä olet minun vaimoni, he\\ntappavat minut mutta jättävät sinut henkiin.\\nSano siis, että olet minun sisareni, jotta minua\\nkohdeltaisiin sinun takiasi hyvin ja saisin sinun\\nansiostasi pitää henkeni.\"\\nKun Abram saapui Egyptiin, egyptiläiset\\nhavaitsivat, että Sarai oli hyvin kaunis nainen.\\nSarain nähtyään faraon virkamiehet ylistivät\\nhäntä faraolle, ja hänet haettiin palatsiin.\\nFarao kohteli Abramia hyvin Sarain takia, ja\\nAbram sai lampaita ja vuohia, nautakarjaa ja aaseja,\\norjia ja orjattaria sekä aasintammoja ja kameleita.\\nMutta Herra antoi faraon ja hänen palatsinsa\\nväen sairastua ankariin tauteihin Abramin vaimon\\nSarain tähden. \\nSilloin farao kutsutti Abramin\\nluokseen ja sanoi: \"Mitä oletkaan minulle tehnyt!\\nMiksi et kertonut minulle, että hän on vaimosi?\\nMiksi sanoit häntä sisareksesi, niin että minä\\nsaatoin ottaa hänet vaimokseni? Siinä on vaimosi,\\nota hänet ja mene matkoihisi!\" \\nSitten farao\\nantoi miehilleen käskyn toimittaa Abram, hänen\\nvaimonsa ja koko hänen omaisuutensa maasta pois.\\nNiin Abram palasi Egyptistä Negeviin, mukanaan\\nvaimonsa ja koko omaisuutensa, ja Loot seurasi häntä. \\nAbram oli hyvin rikas; hänellä oli karjaa,\\nhopeaa ja kultaa. \\nNegevistä hän siirtyi Beteliä\\nkohti kulkien leiripaikalta toiselle, kunnes saapui\\nsiihen Betelin ja Ain väliseen paikkaan, jossa hänen\\ntelttansa oli aikaisemmin ollut \\nja jonne hän oli\\nrakentanut alttarin. Siellä Abram rukoili Herraa.\\nMyös Lootilla, joka kulki Abramin mukana, oli\\nlampaita, vuohia, nautakarjaa ja telttoja. \\nMutta\\nlaidunmaata ei ollut tarpeeksi, että he olisivat\\nvoineet pysyä yhdessä, sillä heillä oli runsaasti\\nkarjaa. \\nSiksi Abramin ja Lootin karjapaimenten\\nkesken syntyi riitaa. Siihen aikaan maassa asui\\nkanaanilaisia ja perissiläisiä.\\nAbram sanoi Lootille: \"Ei sovi, että meidän tai\\nmeidän karjapaimentemme välillä on riitaa, sillä me\\nolemme sukulaisia ja veljiä keskenämme. \\nOnhan\\nkoko maa avoinna sinun edessäsi. Eroa siis minusta.\\nJos sinä menet vasemmalle, niin minä menen oikealle.\\nJos sinä menet oikealle, niin minä menen vasemmalle.\" \\nLoot katsoi ympärilleen ja näki, että\\nJordanin alanko oli runsasvetistä seutua.

Pilkottuaan puita polttouhria varten hän\\nlähti matkaan kohti paikkaa, jonne Jumala oli\\nkäskenyt hänen mennä. \\nKolmantena päivänä Abraham\\nnäki paikan etäältä. \\nSilloin hän sanoi\\npalvelijoilleen: \"Jääkää tänne ja pitäkää huolta\\naasista, minä ja poika menemme tuonne rukoilemaan ja\\npalaamme sitten luoksenne.\" \\nAbraham otti\\npolttouhripuut ja antoi ne Iisakin kannettavaksi;\\nhän itse otti tulen ja veitsen, ja sitten he\\njatkoivat yhdessä matkaa. \\nIisak sanoi isälleen\\nAbrahamille: \"Isä!\" Ja Abraham sanoi: \"Niin,\\npoikani?\" Iisak sanoi: \"Tässä on tuli ja puut, mutta\\nmissä on karitsa polttouhriksi?\" \\nAbraham vastasi:\\n\"Jumala katsoo kyllä itselleen karitsan\\npolttouhriksi, poikani.\" Sitten he jatkoivat yhdessä\\nmatkaa.\\nKun he tulivat paikkaan, jonka Jumala oli Abrahamille osoittanut,\\nAbraham rakensi sinne alttarin ja latoi puut paikoilleen. Sitten hän\\nsitoi poikansa Iisakin ja pani hänet alttarille puiden päälle.\\nMutta kun Abraham tarttui veitseen uhratakseen\\npoikansa, \\nHerran enkeli huusi hänelle taivaasta:\\n\"Abraham, Abraham!\" Abraham vastasi: \"Tässä olen.\"\\nHerran enkeli sanoi: \"Älä koske poikaan äläkä\\ntee hänelle mitään. Nyt minä tiedän, että sinä\\npelkäät ja rakastat Jumalaa, kun et kieltäytynyt\\nuhraamasta edes ainoaa poikaasi.\" \\nJa kun Abraham\\nkatsoi ympärilleen, hän huomasi oinaan, joka oli\\nsarvistaan takertunut pensaikkoon. Abraham kävi\\nhakemassa oinaan ja uhrasi sen polttouhriksi\\npoikansa sijasta. \\nAbraham antoi sille paikalle\\nnimeksi \"Herra katsoo\". Niinpä vielä tänäkin päivänä\\npuhutaan \"Herrankatsomavuoresta\".\\nHerran enkeli huusi Abrahamille uudelleen\\ntaivaasta: \\n\"Näin sanoo Herra: Koska sinä tämän\\nteit etkä kieltänyt minulta ainoaa poikaasi, minä\\nvannon itseni kautta, \\nettä siunaan sinua runsain\\nmäärin ja annan sinulle jälkeläisiä niin paljon,\\nettä he ovat kuin taivaan tähdet tai hiekanjyvät\\nmeren rannalla, ja sinun jälkeläisesi valloittavat\\nvihollistensa kaupungit. \\nSinun jälkeläistesi\\nsaama siunaus tulee siunaukseksi kaikille maailman\\nkansoille, koska sinä olit minun äänelleni kuuliainen.\"\\nSitten Abraham palasi palvelijoiden luo, ja he\\nlähtivät yhdessä Beersebaan. Ja Abraham jäi asumaan\\nBeersebaan.\\nNäiden tapausten jälkeen Abraham sai tietää,\\nettä Milka oli synnyttänyt poikia hänen veljelleen\\nNahorille. \\nNämä olivat Us, esikoinen, tämän veli\\nBus ja Kemuel, josta tuli aramealaisten kantaisä,\\nKesed, Haso, Pildas, Jidlaf ja Betuel.\\nBetuelille syntyi Rebekka. Kahdeksan poikaa\\nsynnytti Milka Nahorille, Abrahamin veljelle.\\nMyös Nahorin sivuvaimo, joka oli nimeltään\\nReuma, synnytti lapsia. Nämä olivat Tebah, Gaham,\\nTahas ja Maaka.\\nJudit Sananmukaisesti: Sinun siemenessäsi tulevat siunatuiksi kaikki maan kansat. \\nSaara eli sadankahdenkymmenenseitsemän vuoden\\nikäiseksi; se oli Saaran elinikä. \\nHän kuoli Kirjat-Arbassa eli Hebronissa, Kanaaninmaassa. Abraham\\nvietti siellä Saaran valittajaiset ja itki häntä.\\nSitten Abraham nousi vainajan äärestä, meni\\nheettiläisten puheille ja sanoi: \\n\"Minä olen\\nmuukalainen, vieras teidän parissanne. Antakaa\\nminulle maata oman sukuhaudan paikaksi, jotta saisin\\nkätkeä sinne vainajani.\" \\nHeettiläiset vastasivat\\nAbrahamille: \\n\"Herra, sinä Jumalan ruhtinas meidän keskuudessamme! Sinä saat haudata\\nvainajasi parhaaseen hautaan, mikä meillä on. Kuka tahansa meistä\\nantaa sinun haudata vainajasi omaan sukuhautaansa.\"\\nAbraham kiitti seudun heettiläisiä asukkaita\\nkumartaen maahan saakka, \\nmutta sanoi heille\\nvielä: \"Jos kerran teille sopii, että minä hautaan\\ntänne vainajani, niin pyydän teitä puhumaan\\nEfronille, Soharin pojalle, minun puolestani,\\nettä hän myisi minulle omistamansa Makpelan\\nluolan, joka on hänen tiluksiensa laidassa. Minä\\nhaluan teidän läsnä ollessanne ostaa sen häneltä\\ntäydestä hinnasta sukuhaudaksemme.\"\\nEfron oli istumassa muiden heettiläisten\\njoukossa kaupunginportin aukiolla, ja hän vastasi\\nAbrahamille kokousväen kuullen: \\n\"Kuuntele minua,\\nherrani! Minä lahjoitan sinulle koko vainion ja\\nluolan, joka siellä on. Minä annan sen sinulle\\nkaupunkini miesten nähden. Hautaa siis vainajasi!\"\\nSilloin Abraham kumarsi syvään kaupungin\\nmiehille \\nja sanoi Efronille kaikkien kuullen:\\n\"Jospa kuitenkin kuuntelisit minua! Minä annan\\nsinulle maksun siitä vainiosta, myy se minulle, niin\\nhautaan sinne vainajani.\" \\nEfron vastasi Abrahamille: \\n\"Kuuntele minua, herrani! Neljänsadan\\nhopeasekelin maapala -- mitäpä se meidän kesken\\nmerkitsee! Hautaa vainajasi.\" \\nAbraham ymmärsi\\nEfronin tarkoituksen ja punnitsi hänelle\\nhopeamäärän, jonka tämä oli heettiläisten kuullen\\nmaininnut, neljäsataa sekeliä maksuna käypää hopeaa.\\nNiin siirtyivät Efronin vainio, joka oli\\nMakpelassa Mamren lähistöllä, siellä sijaitseva\\nluola sekä tällä alueella kasvavat puut\\nAbrahamin omistukseen heettiläisten, Efronin\\nkotikaupungin kaikkien miesten, ollessa todistajina.\\nTämän jälkeen Abraham hautasi vaimonsa Saaran\\nMakpelan vainion luolaan, joka on Mamren eli\\nHebronin lähistöllä Kanaaninmaassa. \\nVainio ja\\nsiellä oleva luola siirtyivät näin heettiläisiltä\\nAbrahamille sukuhaudaksi.\\nAbraham oli tullut vanhaksi ja ikääntyneeksi, ja\\nHerra oli siunannut häntä kaikin tavoin. \\nAbraham\\nsanoi nyt palvelijalleen, taloutensa vanhimmalle,\\njoka huolehti hänen koko omaisuudestaan: \"Kosketa\\nminua nivusiin \\nja vanno minulle Herran, taivaan\\nja maan Jumalan kautta, ettet ota minun pojalleni\\nvaimoa kanaanilaisten naapureitteni tyttäristä\\nvaan menet synnyinmaahani, sukuni luo, ja tuot\\nsieltä vaimon pojalleni Iisakille.\" \\nPalvelija\\nkysyi häneltä: \"Entä jos tyttö ei haluakaan lähteä\\nminun mukaani tänne? Onko minun silloin vietävä\\npoikasi siihen maahan, josta olet lähtenyt?\"\\nAbraham sanoi hänelle: \"Älä missään tapauksessa\\nvie poikaani sinne. \\nHerra, taivaan Jumala, joka\\nvei minut sukuni parista ja syntymämaastani ja\\nvannoi antavansa minun jälkeläisilleni tämän maan,\\nlähettää enkelinsä sinun edelläsi, niin että\\nonnistut noutamaan sieltä vaimon pojalleni. \\nEllei\\ntyttö halua lähteä mukaasi, olet vapaa valastasi,\\nmutta poikaani älä sinne vie.\" \\nJa palvelija\\nkosketti isäntäänsä Abrahamia nivusiin ja vannoi\\nvaaditun valan.\\nPalvelija otti isäntänsä laumasta kymmenen kamelia sekä kaikenlaisia\\nkalleuksia hänen tavaroistaan ja lähti Mesopotamiaan, Nahorin\\nkaupunkiin.\\nSiellä hän pysähtyi kameleineen kaupungin\\nulkopuolelle kaivon luo. Oli ilta, se aika, jolloin\\nkaupungin naiset tulevat kaivolle vettä noutamaan.\\nPalvelija rukoili: \"Herra, minun isäntäni\\nAbrahamin Jumala! Osoita hyvyytesi isännälleni\\nAbrahamille ja anna tapahtua näin: \\nKun minä\\nseison kaivon luona ja kaupunkilaisten tyttäret\\ntulevat hakemaan vettä, \\nniin minä sanon yhdelle\\ntytöistä: \\'Kallistaisitko ruukkua, että saan juoda.\\'\\nJos hän silloin sanoo: \\'Juo! Minä juotan\\nkamelisikin\\', niin hän on juuri se, jonka olet\\ntarkoittanut palvelijallesi Iisakille. Siitä minä\\ntiedän, että olet osoittanut hyvyytesi isännälleni.\"\\nTuskin hän oli ehtinyt tämän lausua, kun\\nkaivolle tuli Rebekka, Betuelin tytär, ruukku\\nolkapäällään. Betuel oli Abrahamin veljen Nahorin ja\\ntämän vaimon Milkan poika. \\nTyttö oli hyvin\\nkaunis, neitsyt, johon mies ei ollut koskenut. Hän\\nlaskeutui portaita lähteelle, täytti ruukkunsa ja\\nnousi sieltä ylös. \\nSilloin palvelija riensi\\nhäntä vastaan ja sanoi: \"Anna minun juoda hiukan\\nvettä ruukustasi.\" \\nTyttö sanoi: \"Juo, herrani\",\\nlaski ruukun heti kätensä varaan ja antoi hänen\\njuoda. \\nKun palvelija oli juonut kyllikseen,\\ntyttö sanoi: \"Minä haen myös sinun kameleillesi\\nvettä niin paljon kuin ne juovat.\" \\nHän tyhjensi\\nnopeasti ruukkunsa juottoaltaaseen, juoksi sitten\\nuudelleen vettä hakemaan ja kantoi sitä miehen\\nkaikille kameleille. \\nMies tarkkaili häntä mitään\\npuhumatta nähdäkseen, oliko Herra antanut hänen\\nmatkansa onnistua.\\nKun kamelit olivat saaneet juodakseen, mies otti\\nesiin puoli sekeliä painavan kultaisen nenärenkaan,\\nantoi sen tytölle ja pujotti hänen käsiinsä kaksi\\nkultaista rannerengasta, jotka painoivat kymmenen\\nsekeliä. \\nSitten hän sanoi: \"Kerrohan, kenen\\ntytär sinä olet. Onko isäsi talossa meille tilaa\\nyöpyä?\" \\nTyttö vastasi hänelle: \"Isäni on Betuel,\\nMilkan ja Nahorin poika.\" \\nJa hän sanoi vielä:\\n\"Meillä on olkia ja rehua yllin kyllin ja myös tilaa\\nyöpymiseen.\" \\nMies lankesi polvilleen, kumarsi\\nmaahan asti kiittäen Herraa \\nja sanoi: \"Kiitetty\\nolkoon Herra, isäntäni Abrahamin Jumala, joka on\\nollut hyvä ja uskollinen isännälleni ja ohjannut\\nminut matkallani isäntäni veljen taloon!\"\\nTyttö juoksi kotiin äitinsä luo kertomaan, mitä\\noli tapahtunut. \\nRebekalla oli veli nimeltä\\nLaban, ja tämä riensi kaupungista lähteelle miehen\\nluo, \\nkun oli nähnyt sisarellaan nenärenkaan sekä\\nrannerenkaat ja kuullut, mitä Rebekka kertoi miehen\\nhänelle sanoneen. Laban tavoitti miehen, joka vielä\\nseisoi lähteellä kameleineen, \\nja sanoi hänelle:\\n\"Ole tervetullut, sinä Herran siunaama! Miksi jäisit\\ntänne ulos, kun minä olen jo tehnyt tilaa taloon ja\\nvarannut paikan kameleille?\" \\nNiin mies meni taloon ja riisui kamelit, ja Laban toi kameleille\\nolkia ja rehua ja palvelijalle sekä hänen seuralaisilleen vettä jalkojen pesua varten. \\nMutta kun\\npalvelijan eteen pantiin syötävää, hän sanoi: \"Minä\\nen syö, ennen kuin olen kertonut asiani.\" Laban\\nsanoi: \"Puhu!\"\\nMies sanoi:\\n\"Minä olen Abrahamin palvelija. \\nHerra on\\nsuuresti siunannut isäntääni, tehnyt hänet rikkaaksi\\nja antanut hänelle lampaita, vuohia ja nautakarjaa,\\nkultaa ja hopeaa, orjia ja orjattaria, kameleita ja\\naaseja. \\nSaara, minun isäntäni vaimo, on vanhoilla päivillään synnyttänyt isännälleni pojan, ja\\nisäntäni on antanut tälle pojalle koko omaisuutensa.\\nMutta isäntäni vannotti minua sanoen: \\'Älä ota\\nminun pojalleni vaimoa kanaanilaisten naapureitteni\\ntyttäristä, \\nvaan mene isäni kotiin ja sukuni luo\\nja tuo sieltä pojalleni vaimo.\\' \\nMinä sanoin\\nisännälleni: \\'Entä jos tyttö ei lähde mukaani?\\'\\nHän sanoi minulle: \\'Herra, jonka tahdon\\nmukaisesti minä olen vaeltanut, lähettää enkelinsä\\nsinun mukaasi ja antaa matkasi onnistua, niin että\\nlöydät pojalleni vaimon minun suvustani ja isäni\\nperheestä. \\nOlet vapaa valastasi vain, jos tulet\\nsukuni luo eikä sinun mukaasi anneta ketään.

Näin palvelija vei Rebekan mukanaan.\\nIisak oli tällä välin siirtynyt Lahai-Roin\\nkaivon tienoille; hän näet asui Negevin maassa.\\nEräänä iltana Iisak lähti kävelemään, ja kun hän\\nkohotti katseensa, hän näki kamelikaravaanin\\nlähestyvän. \\nKun Rebekka puolestaan näki Iisakin,\\nhän pudottautui kamelinsa selästä \\nja kysyi\\npalvelijalta: \"Kuka on tuo mies, joka tulee tuolta\\nmeitä vastaan?\" Palvelija vastasi: \"Hän on minun\\nisäntäni.\" Silloin Rebekka otti huivin ja peitti\\nkasvonsa. \\nPalvelija kertoi Iisakille kaiken,\\nmitä oli tapahtunut. \\nIisak vei Rebekan äitinsä\\nSaaran telttaan ja otti hänet vaimokseen.

Ja Ismael joutui alinomaa\\nvastakkain veljiensä kanssa.\\nTämä on kertomus Abrahamin pojan Iisakin\\nsuvusta. Abrahamille syntyi Iisak. \\nIisak oli\\nnelikymmenvuotias ottaessaan vaimokseen Rebekan,\\njoka oli Mesopotamiassa asuvan aramealaisen Betuelin\\ntytär ja Labanin sisar. \\nIisak rukoili Herraa\\nvaimonsa puolesta, sillä tämä oli hedelmätön. Herra\\nkuuli hänen rukouksensa, ja Rebekka tuli raskaaksi.\\nMutta lapset potkivat toisiaan Rebekan kohdussa,\\nja hän sanoi: \"Miksi minulle pitää sattua\\ntällaista?\" Hän meni kysymään neuvoa Herralta,\\nja Herra sanoi:\\n-- Kaksi kansaa on kohdussasi,\\nkaksi heimoa sinusta haarautuu.\\nToinen heimo on toista vahvempi,\\nvanhempi on palveleva nuorempaa.\\nAikanaan Rebekka synnytti kaksoset.\\nEnsimmäisenä syntynyt oli iholtaan punaruskea ja\\nkauttaaltaan karvainen kuin vuohenkarvaviitta, ja\\nhän sai nimen Esau. \\nSitten syntyi hänen\\nveljensä, ja hän piti kädellään kiinni Esaun\\nkantapäästä; siksi hän sai nimen Jaakob. Iisak oli\\nheidän syntyessään kuusikymmenvuotias.\\nKun pojat varttuivat, Esausta tuli taitava\\nmetsästäjä ja erämies, mutta Jaakob oli rauhallinen\\nja viihtyi kotosalla. \\nKoska Iisak söi mielellään\\nriistaa, hän rakasti enemmän Esauta, mutta Rebekalle\\noli Jaakob rakkaampi.\\nKerran, kun Jaakob valmisti keittoa, Esau tuli\\nväsyneenä metsästysretkeltään \\nja sanoi Jaakobille: \"Anna vähän tuota ruskeaa, tuota ruskeaa keittoa,\\nminä olen ihan lopussa.\" Tästä syystä hän sai nimen Edom. \\nMutta Jaakob sanoi: \"Myy minulle\\nensin esikoisuutesi.\" \\nEsau sanoi: \"Minä varmaan\\nkohta kuolen. Mitä hyötyä minulle on esikoisuudesta?\" \\nJaakob sanoi: \"Vanno minulle ensin.\" Niin\\nEsau vannoi ja myi Jaakobille esikoisuutensa.\\nSitten Jaakob antoi hänelle leipää ja papukeittoa, ja Esau söi ja joi,\\nnousi ja meni tiehensä.  Niin vähäarvoisena hän piti esikoisuuttaan.\\nNimi Esau merkitsee \\'karvainen\\', ja hänen myöhemmän\\nasuinpaikkansa Seirin nimi viittaa sekin \\'karvaiseen\\'. Häntä kutsutaan\\nmyös Edomiksi eli \\'punaiseksi\\' tai \\'ruskeaksi\\'. \\nNimi Jaakob muistuttaa sekä heprean sanaa aqeb \\'kantapää\\' että sanaa aqab \\'hän pettää\\'. \\nKs. selitystä jakeeseen . \\nMaahan tuli nälänhätä, toinen kuin Abrahamin\\naikaan sattunut. Silloin Iisak lähti filistealaisten\\nkuninkaan Abimelekin luo Gerariin. \\nHerra ilmestyi\\nIisakille ja sanoi: \"Älä lähde Egyptiin, vaan pysy\\nsillä seudulla, jonka minä sinulle osoitan. \\nJää\\nasumaan tähän maahan, niin minä olen sinun kanssasi\\nja siunaan sinua. Sinulle ja sinun jälkeläisillesi\\nminä annan kaikki nämä seudut ja pidän näin voimassa\\nsen valan, jonka vannoin isällesi Abrahamille.\\nMinä annan sinulle jälkeläisiä niin paljon, että\\nhe ovat kuin taivaan tähdet, ja annan heille koko\\ntämän maan. Sinun jälkeläistesi saama siunaus tulee\\nsiunaukseksi kaikille maailman kansoille, \\nkoska\\nAbraham oli minun äänelleni kuuliainen ja noudatti\\nsitä, mihin minä hänet velvoitin. Hän piti minun\\nkäskyni, määräykseni ja lakini.\" \\nNiin Iisak jäi\\nasumaan Gerariin.\\nKun Gerarin asukkaat kyselivät, kuka Rebekka oli, Iisak sanoi: \"Hän on\\nminun sisareni.\" Hän ei uskaltanut sanoa, että Rebekka oli hänen\\nvaimonsa, koska pelkäsi seudun miesten tappavan hänet Rebekan takia,\\njoka oli hyvin kaunis.\\nIisak oli asunut siellä\\njonkin aikaa, kun filistealaisten kuningas Abimelek\\nkerran näki ikkunastaan hänen hyväilevän Rebekkaa.\\nSilloin Abimelek kutsutti Iisakin luokseen ja\\nsanoi: \"Hänhän onkin sinun vaimosi! Miten saatoit\\nsanoa häntä sisareksesi?\" Iisak vastasi hänelle:\\n\"Sanoin niin, koska pelkäsin, että minut\\nsurmattaisiin hänen vuokseen.\" \\nAbimelek sanoi:\\n\"Mitä oletkaan tehnyt meille! Se vielä olisi\\npuuttunut, että joku meikäläisistä olisi maannut\\nsinun vaimosi kanssa! Silloin sinä olisit syössyt\\nmeidät raskaaseen syntiin.\" \\nJa Abimelek ilmoitti\\nkoko kansalleen: \"Joka kajoaa tähän mieheen tai\\nhänen vaimoonsa, on kuoleman oma.\"\\nEräänä vuonna Iisak sai siinä maassa kylvöstään\\nsatakertaisen sadon. Herra siunasi häntä. \\nHän\\nvaurastui vaurastumistaan ja oli lopulta hyvin\\nrikas. \\nKoska hänelle oli karttunut lampaita,\\nvuohia ja nautakarjaa sekä paljon palvelusväkeä,\\nfilistealaiset alkoivat kadehtia häntä. \\nNiin\\nfilistealaiset tukkivat ja täyttivät hiekalla kaikki\\nne kaivot, jotka hänen isänsä Abrahamin palvelijat\\nolivat aikoinaan kaivaneet. \\nSitten Abimelek\\nsanoi Iisakille: \"Lähde pois meidän luotamme,\\nsinusta on tullut aivan liian mahtava.\"\\nIisak lähti sieltä, pystytti telttansa Gerarin\\njoenuoman varrelle ja jäi sinne asumaan. \\nHän kaivatti uudelleen auki isänsä Abrahamin päivinä kaivetut kaivot,\\njotka filistealaiset olivat Abrahamin kuoleman jälkeen tukkineet, ja\\nantoi niille samat nimet kuin hänen isänsä oli antanut.\\nIisakin palvelijat alkoivat sitten kaivaa kaivoa\\njoenuomaan ja löysivät vesisuonen. \\nMutta Gerarin\\npaimenet rupesivat riitelemään Iisakin paimenien\\nkanssa ja sanoivat: \"Vesi kuuluu meille.\" Niin kaivo\\nsai nimen Esek, koska siitä oli tullut kiistaa.\\nIisakin palvelijat kaivoivat vielä toisen kaivon\\nja joutuivat riitaan siitäkin, ja sille hän antoi\\nnimen Sitna. \\nSitten hän siirtyi sieltä pois ja\\nkaivatti vielä uuden kaivon, eikä siitä enää\\nsyntynyt riitaa. Sen nimeksi tuli Rehobot, sillä\\nIisak sanoi: \"Nyt Herra on antanut meille väljästi\\ntilaa, niin että voimme levitä laajalle tässä maassa.\"\\nGerarin seudulta Iisak siirtyi Beersebaan.\\nEnsimmäisenä yönä Herra ilmestyi hänelle ja\\nsanoi: \"Minä olen sinun isäsi Abrahamin Jumala. Älä\\npelkää, minä olen sinun kanssasi. Palvelijani\\nAbrahamin tähden minä siunaan sinua ja teen suureksi\\nsinun jälkeläistesi määrän.\" \\nIisak rakensi sinne\\nalttarin ja rukoili Herraa. Hän pystytti sinne\\ntelttansa, ja hänen palvelijansa kaivoivat kaivon.\\nAbimelek tuli Gerarista Iisakin luo mukanaan\\nlähin miehensä Ahussat ja sotaväen päällikkö Pikol.\\nIisak kysyi heiltä: \"Minkä takia te nyt tulitte\\nminun luokseni, vaikka vihaatte minua ja hääditte\\nminut luotanne?\" \\nHe vastasivat: \"Me olemme nähneet, että Herra on sinun kanssasi. Siksi\\najattelimme, että sinun ja meidän välillämme tulisi olla valalla\\nvahvistettu sopimus. Me haluamme tehdä liiton sinun kanssasi,\\nettet tekisi meille mitään\\npahaa. Emme mekään ole tehneet sinulle pahaa vaan\\npelkkää hyvää ja olemme päästäneet sinut rauhassa\\nmenemään.

Sitten Iisak hyvästeli heidät, ja he\\nerosivat hyvässä sovussa.\\nSamana päivänä tulivat Iisakin palvelijat kertomaan hänelle kaivosta,\\njota olivat olleet kaivamassa, ja sanoivat: \"Me löysimme vettä.\"\\nHän antoi\\nsille kaivolle nimen Sibea.\\nSen tähden siellä sijaitsevan kaupungin nimi on vielä tänäkin päivänä\\nBeerseba.\\nKun Esau oli nelikymmenvuotias, hän otti\\nvaimoikseen Beerin tyttären Jehuditin ja Elonin\\ntyttären Basematin, jotka olivat heettiläisiä.\\nNämä naiset tuottivat Iisakille ja Rebekalle\\npaljon mielipahaa.\\nNimi Esek merkitsee \\'kiista\\'. \\nNimi Sitna merkitsee \\'riita\\'. \\nNimi Rehobot merkitsee \\'väljyys\\'. \\nNimi Sibea merkitsee \\'vala\\', \\'seitsemän\\', vrt.\\nKun Iisak oli tullut vanhaksi ja hänen silmänsä\\nolivat hämärtyneet, niin ettei hän enää nähnyt, hän\\nkutsui luokseen vanhemman poikansa Esaun ja sanoi\\nhänelle: \"Poikani!\" Esau vastasi: \"Mitä, isä?\"\\nIisak sanoi: \"Minä olen tullut vanhaksi ja saatan\\npian kuolla. \\nOta nyt varusteesi, nuoliviinesi ja\\njousesi, ja lähde metsästämään minulle riistaa.\\nLaita siitä herkkuruokaa, sellaista josta minä\\npidän, ja tuo sitä minulle syötäväksi, jotta voisin\\nsiunata sinut ennen kuin kuolen.\"\\nMutta Rebekka kuunteli, kun Iisak puhui pojalleen\\nEsaulle. Kun Esau oli lähtenyt metsästämään riistaa\\nisäänsä varten, \\nRebekka sanoi pojalleen Jaakobille: \"Minä kuulin äsken, että isäsi sanoi veljellesi\\nEsaulle: \\n\\'Tuo minulle riistaa ja valmista minulle\\nherkkuruokaa, jotta voisin siunata sinut Herran\\nnimessä ennen kuin kuolen.\\' \\nNyt, poikani, tottele\\nminua ja tee niin kuin minä käsken. \\nHae minulle\\nlaumasta kaksi hyvää nuorta vuohta, niin minä teen\\nniistä isäsi mieliruokaa. \\nVie sinä se isällesi\\nsyötäväksi, että hän siunaisi sinut ennen kuolemaansa.\"\\nJaakob sanoi silloin äidilleen: \"Mutta veljeni\\nEsau on karvainen ja minun ihoni on sileä. \\nEntä\\njos isä tunnustelee minua? Silloin hän pitää minua\\npetkuttajana, ja minä saan osakseni kirouksen enkä\\nsiunausta.\" \\nHänen äitinsä sanoi: \"Jos niin käy,\\npoikani, kohdatkoon se kirous minua. Tee nyt vain\\nniin kuin minä sanon ja mene hakemaan ne vuohet.\"\\nJaakob haki vuohet äidilleen, ja tämä valmisti\\nniistä Iisakin mieliruokaa. \\nSitten Rebekka otti\\nvanhemman poikansa Esaun parhaat vaatteet, jotka\\nhänellä oli teltassa, ja puki nuoremman poikansa\\nJaakobin niihin. \\nVuohien nahoilla hän peitti\\nJaakobin kädet sekä hänen paljaan kaulansa ja niskansa. \\nSitten hän antoi herkut ja leipomansa\\nleivän Jaakobin käteen.\\nJaakob meni isänsä luo ja sanoi: \"Isä!\" Iisak\\nvastasi: \"Niin, poika, kuka sinä olet?\" \\nJaakob\\nsanoi isälleen: \"Minä olen sinun esikoisesi Esau.\\nOlen tehnyt niin kuin käskit.

Sen jälkeen siunaan sinut.\" Jaakob tarjosi hänelle\\nruokaa ja viiniä, ja hän söi ja joi.\\nSitten Iisak sanoi:\\n\"Tule tänne ja suutele minua, poikani.\" \\nJaakob\\nmeni hänen luokseen ja suuteli häntä, ja Iisak tunsi\\nhänen vaatteidensa hajun ja siunasi hänet sanoen:\\n-- Poikani tuoksu on kuin maan tuoksu,\\nmaan, jonka Herra on siunannut.\\nJumala suokoon sinulle taivaan kastetta\\nja maan rehevyyttä,\\nviljaa ja viiniä runsain määrin.\\nKansat palvelkoot sinua\\nja kansakunnat kumartakoot sinua.\\nOle veljiesi herra,\\nja äitisi pojat kumartakoot sinua.\\nKirottuja olkoot ne, jotka sinua kiroavat,\\nja siunattuja ne, jotka sinua siunaavat.\\nIisak oli ehtinyt siunata Jaakobin ja Jaakob oli\\njuuri lähtenyt isänsä luota, kun Esau palasi metsästämästä. \\nHänkin laittoi herkkuruokaa, vei sen\\nisälleen ja sanoi hänelle: \"Nouse, isä, syömään\\npoikasi tuomaa riistaa, että sitten voisit siunata\\nminut.\" \\nHänen isänsä Iisak kysyi: \"Kuka sinä\\nolet?\" Esau vastasi: \"Minä olen poikasi Esau, sinun\\nesikoisesi.\" \\nSilloin Iisak säikähti kovin ja\\nkysyi: \"Kuka se sitten oli, joka kävi metsästämässä\\nja toi minulle riistaa? Minä söin jo ennen sinun\\ntuloasi ja siunasin hänet, ja se siunaus pysyy.\"\\nKun Esau kuuli isänsä sanat, hän alkoi\\näänekkäästi itkeä ja valittaa ja sanoi isälleen:\\n\"Siunaa minutkin, isä!\" \\nSilloin Iisak sanoi:\\n\"Veljesi tuli kavalasti ja vei sinulta siunauksen.\"\\nEsau sanoi: \"Ei häntä suotta Jaakobiksi sanota.\\nHän on pettänyt minut kahteen kertaan: hän vei jo\\nesikoisuuteni, ja nyt hän riisti minulta\\nsiunauksenkin!\" Esau kysyi vielä: \"Eikö sinulle\\njäänyt mitään siunausta minua varten?\" \\nIisak\\nvastasi: \"Minä asetin hänet sinun herraksesi, annoin\\nhänelle palvelijoiksi kaikki hänen veljensä ja\\nvarustin hänet viljalla ja viinillä.

Sitten\\nminä tapan Jaakobin.\" \\nKun Rebekalle kerrottiin, mitä hänen vanhempi poikansa aikoi, hän\\nhaetti luokseen nuoremman poikansa Jaakobin ja sanoi hänelle: \"Veljesi\\nEsau hautoo kostoa ja aikoo tappaa sinut.\\nTee siis, poikani, niin kuin minä neuvon: lähde\\npois ja pakene veljeni Labanin luo Harraniin.\\nViivy siellä jonkin aikaa, kunnes veljesi kiukku\\nhaihtuu. \\nKun veljesi viha on asettunut ja hän on\\nunohtanut, mitä sinä hänelle teit, minä lähetän\\nsinulle sanan ja haetan sinut sieltä. Miksi minun\\npitäisi menettää teidät molemmat yhtenä ja samana\\npäivänä?\"\\nIisakille Rebekka sanoi: \"Minä olen kuollakseni\\nkyllästynyt noihin heettiläisnaisiin! Jos Jaakobkin\\nvielä ottaa tästä maasta heettiläisen vaimon, jonkun\\nsamanlaisen kuin nuo, niin mitä minun enää kannattaa\\nelää?\"\\nKs. selitystä jakeeseen .\\nNiin Iisak kutsui luokseen Jaakobin, siunasi\\nhäntä ja sanoi: \"Älä sinä ota vaimoksesi\\nkanaanilaista naista. \\nLähde Mesopotamiaan äitisi\\nisän Betuelin kotiin ja ota sieltä itsellesi vaimo\\nenosi Labanin tyttäristä. \\nJumala, Kaikkivaltias,\\nsiunatkoon sinua ja tehköön sinut hedelmälliseksi ja\\njälkeläisesi monilukuisiksi, niin että sinusta saa\\nalkunsa suuri kansa. \\nHän antakoon sinulle\\nsamanlaisen siunauksen kuin Abrahamille, sekä\\nsinulle että jälkeläisillesi, niin että saat\\nomaksesi tämän maan, jonka Jumala lupasi Abrahamille\\nja jossa nyt asut muukalaisena.\" \\nSitten Iisak lähetti Jaakobin matkaan, ja Jaakob lähti Mesopotamiaan\\naramealaisen Labanin luo, joka oli Betuelin poika ja Jaakobin ja Esaun\\neno.\\nEsau sai tietää, että Iisak oli siunannut\\nJaakobin ja lähettänyt hänet Mesopotamiaan ottamaan\\nsieltä itselleen vaimon ja että Iisak Jaakobia\\nsiunatessaan oli kieltänyt häntä ottamasta\\nvaimokseen kanaanilaista naista. \\nJaakob totteli\\nisäänsä ja äitiään ja lähti Mesopotamiaan. \\nNyt\\nEsau ymmärsi, ettei hänen isänsä sietänyt\\nkanaanilaisnaisia, \\nja hän meni Abrahamin pojan\\nIsmaelin luo ja otti vaimokseen entisten lisäksi\\nIsmaelin tyttären Mahalatin, joka oli Nebajotin\\nsisar.\\nJaakob lähti Beersebasta ja kulki kohti\\nHarrania. \\nMatkallaan hän jäi auringon laskiessa\\nyöksi erääseen paikkaan, otti siltä paikalta\\npäänalusekseen kiven ja kävi makuulle.\\nYöllä Jaakob näki unessa portaat, jotka ulottuivat maasta taivaaseen,\\nja Jumalan enkelit kulkivat niitä ylös ja alas.\\nSitten hän näki, että Herra\\nseisoi hänen vieressään ja sanoi: \"Minä olen Herra,\\nisäsi Abrahamin Jumala ja Iisakin Jumala. Tämän\\nmaan, jolla sinä makaat, minä annan sinulle ja sinun\\njälkeläisillesi. \\nSinun jälkeläisesi tulevat lukuisiksi kuin maan tomuhiukkaset, ja sinun sukusi\\nlevittäytyy länteen ja itään, pohjoiseen ja etelään.\\nSinun ja sinun jälkeläistesi saama siunaus tulee\\nsiunaukseksi kaikille maailman kansoille. \\nMinä\\nolen sinun kanssasi ja varjelen sinua, minne ikinä\\nmenetkin, ja tuon sinut takaisin tähän maahan. Minä\\nen hylkää sinua, vaan täytän sen, minkä nyt olen\\nsinulle luvannut.\"\\nJaakob heräsi unestaan ja sanoi: \"Herra on totisesti tässä paikassa, enkä minä tiennyt sitä.\"\\nPelko valtasi hänet, ja hän sanoi: \"Kuinka\\npelottavan pyhä tämä paikka onkaan! Tämä on varmaan\\nJumalan asuinsija ja itse taivaan portti.\"\\nAamun valjettua Jaakob otti kiven, joka hänellä\\noli ollut päänalusenaan, pystytti sen patsaaksi ja\\nvuodatti sen päälle öljyä. \\nHän antoi paikalle nimen Betel; sitä ennen kaupungin nimi oli ollut\\nLus.\\nJaakob teki uhrilupauksen ja sanoi: \"Jos\\nHerra on minun kanssani ja varjelee minua tällä\\nmatkallani ja antaa minulle leipää syötäväksi ja\\nvaatteita verhokseni \\nja jos minä saan palata\\nturvallisesti isäni ja sukuni luo, on Herra oleva\\nminun Jumalani. \\nTästä paikasta, johon minä kiven\\npystytin, on tuleva Jumalan pyhäkkö. Kaikesta, mitä\\nsinä annat minulle, minä tuon sinulle kymmenykset.\"\\nNimi Betel merkitsee \\'Jumalan asuinsija\\', \\'pyhäkkö\\'. \\nSitten Jaakob lähti matkaan kohti idän kansojen\\nmaita. \\nSaapuessaan sinne hän huomasi kaivon ja\\nkolme lammaslaumaa makailemassa sen äärellä, sillä\\nsiitä kaivosta juotettiin karjalaumoja. Kaivon suulla oli iso kivi, \\nja vasta kun kaikki paimenet olivat kokoontuneet sinne laumoineen,\\nkivi vieritettiin kaivon suulta ja lampaat ja vuohet juotettiin.\\nSitten kivi pantiin taas paikoilleen kaivon suulle.\\nJaakob kysyi paimenilta: \"Mistä te olette kotoisin, veljet?\" He\\nvastasivat: \"Harranista.\"\\nJaakob\\nkysyi vielä: \"Tunnetteko Labanin, Nahorin pojan?\" He\\nvastasivat: \"Kyllä tunnemme.\" \\nHän kysyi: \"Mitä\\nLabanille kuuluu?\" Ja he vastasivat: \"Hyvää hänelle\\nkuuluu, ja tuolta onkin tulossa hänen tyttärensä\\nRaakel lampaineen.\" \\nJaakob sanoi: \"Nyt on vielä\\ntäysi päivä ja liian varhaista ajaa karjaa kokoon.\\nJuottakaa vain lampaat ja viekää ne takaisin laitumelle.\" \\nMutta he sanoivat: \"Ei, sitä me emme voi\\ntehdä, ennen kuin kaikki laumat ovat koossa ja kivi\\nvieritetään kaivon suulta. Vasta sitten me voimme\\njuottaa lampaat.\"\\nJaakobin vielä puhuessa heidän kanssaan Raakel\\ntoi sinne isänsä lammaslauman; sen paimentaminen oli\\nnäet hänen tehtävänsä. \\nKun Jaakob näki Raakelin,\\nenonsa Labanin tyttären, ja hänen lampaansa, hän\\nastui esiin, vieritti kiven kaivon suulta ja juotti\\nlampaat. \\nSitten Jaakob suuteli Raakelia ja\\npuhkesi itkuun. \\nHän kertoi Raakelille olevansa\\nhänen isänsä sukua, Rebekan poika, ja Raakel juoksi\\nkertomaan isälleen. \\nKun Laban sai kuulla\\nsisarenpoikansa tulosta, hän riensi Jaakobia\\nvastaan, syleili ja suuteli häntä ja vei hänet\\nkotiinsa. Jaakob kertoi Labanille kaiken, mitä\\nhänelle oli tapahtunut, \\nja Laban sanoi hänelle:\\n\"Sinä olet todellakin samaa luuta ja lihaa kuin\\nminä.\"\\nKun Jaakob oli asunut Labanin luona kuukauden\\nverran, \\nLaban sanoi Jaakobille: \"Miksi sinun\\npitäisi tehdä minulle ilmaista työtä, vaikka oletkin\\nsukulaiseni? Sano, mitä haluat palkaksesi.\"\\nLabanilla oli kaksi tytärtä; vanhemman nimi oli\\nLea ja nuoremman Raakel. \\nLealla oli lempeät\\nsilmät, mutta Raakel oli kaunis vartaloltaan ja\\nkasvoiltaan. \\nJaakob oli rakastunut Raakeliin, ja\\nniin hän sanoi: \"Minä palvelen sinua seitsemän\\nvuotta, jos annat minulle nuoremman tyttäresi Raakelin.\" \\nLaban sanoi: \"Parempi minun on antaa hänet\\nsinulle kuin jollekin toiselle. Jää minun luokseni\\nasumaan.\" \\nNiin Jaakob palveli seitsemän vuotta\\nsaadakseen Raakelin, ja ne vuodet tuntuivat hänestä\\nvain muutamalta päivältä, koska hän rakasti\\nRaakelia.\\nSitten Jaakob sanoi Labanille: \"Anna minulle\\nvaimoni. Palvelusaikani on kulunut umpeen, ja nyt\\ntahdon saada hänet.\" \\nLaban kutsui silloin koolle\\npaikkakunnan kaikki asukkaat ja järjesti hääpidot.\\nMutta illan tultua hän haki tyttärensä Lean ja\\nvei hänet Jaakobin luo, ja Jaakob yhtyi häneen.\\nLaban antoi orjattarensa Silpan tyttärelleen\\nLealle orjattareksi.\\nKun aamu koitti, Jaakob huomasi, että olikin\\nsaanut Lean. Hän sanoi Labanille: \"Mitä oletkaan\\nminulle tehnyt! Minähän palvelin sinua saadakseni\\nRaakelin. Miksi sinä petit minua?\" \\nMutta Laban\\nvastasi: \"Ei ole meillä päin tapana naittaa nuorempaa tytärtä ennen vanhempaa. \\nVietä nyt vain\\nhääviikko loppuun tämän vanhemman kanssa, niin saat\\nsitten palkaksi nuoremmankin, kunhan pysyt minun\\npalveluksessani toiset seitsemän vuotta.\" \\nJaakob\\nsuostui siihen ja vietti hääviikon loppuun Lean\\nkanssa. Sen jälkeen Laban antoi myös tyttärensä\\nRaakelin hänelle vaimoksi \\nja antoi orjattarensa\\nBilhan tyttärelleen orjattareksi. \\nJaakob yhtyi\\nmyös Raakeliin, ja Raakel oli hänelle rakkaampi kuin\\nLea. Näin Jaakob palveli Labanin luona vielä toiset\\nseitsemän vuotta.\\nKun Herra huomasi, että Jaakob syrji Leaa, hän\\nantoi Lean tulla raskaaksi, mutta Raakel pysyi lapsettomana. \\nNiin Lea synnytti pojan, jolle hän\\nantoi nimeksi Ruuben, sillä hän ajatteli: \"Herra on\\nnähnyt minun kurjuuteni.\\nNyt mieheni alkaa rakastaa\\nminua.\" \\nSitten hän tuli jälleen raskaaksi, synnytti pojan ja sanoi: \"Herra on\\nkuullut, että mieheni syrjii minua, ja siksi hän antoi minulle myös\\ntämän pojan.\" Ja hän antoi pojalle nimeksi Simeon.\\nSitten hän tuli taas raskaaksi, synnytti pojan\\nja sanoi: \"Nyt mieheni lopultakin kääntyy minun\\npuoleeni, koska olen synnyttänyt hänelle kolme\\npoikaa.\" Sen vuoksi poika sai nimekseen Leevi.\\nJa Lea tuli taaskin raskaaksi, synnytti pojan ja\\nsanoi: \"Vihdoinkin saan ylistää Herraa.\" Siksi hän\\nantoi pojalle nimeksi Juuda. Sitten hän ei enää\\nsynnyttänyt.\\nNimi Ruuben muistuttaa heprean ilmausta ra\\'a be\\'onji\\n\\'hän on nähnyt kurjuuteni\\'. \\nNimi Simeon muistuttaa heprean sanaa sama \\'hän on\\nkuullut\\'. \\nNimi Leevi muistuttaa heprean sanaa lawa, josta muoto\\njillawe on suomeksi \\'hän kääntyy puoleeni\\'. \\nJuudan nimen hepreankielinen muoto Jehuda muistuttaa sanaa hoda, josta\\nmuoto ode on suomeksi \\'saan ylistää\\'.\\nKun Raakel näki, ettei hän saanut lapsia, hän\\nalkoi kadehtia sisartaan ja sanoi Jaakobille: \"Auta\\nminua saamaan lapsia, tai muuten minä kuolen!\"\\nJaakob suuttui Raakelille ja sanoi: \"Olenko minä\\nmuka Jumala? Minäkö olen estänyt sinua saamasta\\nlapsia?\" \\nRaakel sanoi: \"Tuossa on orjattareni\\nBilha. Tee hänen kanssaan lapsia, jotka tulevat\\nminun omikseni. Näin minustakin voi tulla äiti.\"\\nRaakel antoi orjattarensa Bilhan Jaakobille\\nvaimoksi, ja Jaakob yhtyi häneen. \\nBilha tuli\\nraskaaksi ja synnytti Jaakobille pojan. \\nSilloin\\nRaakel sanoi: \"Jumala on ratkaissut asian minun\\nhyväkseni. Hän on kuullut rukoukseni ja antanut\\nminulle pojan.\" Sen vuoksi Raakel antoi pojalle\\nnimeksi Dan. \\nSitten Raakelin orjatar Bilha tuli\\nuudelleen raskaaksi ja synnytti Jaakobille toisen\\npojan. \\nRaakel sanoi: \"Minä olen käynyt sisareni\\nkanssa ankaran kamppailun, ja nyt olen voittanut.\"\\nJa hän antoi pojalle nimeksi Naftali.\\nKun Lea näki, ettei hän enää saanut lapsia, hän\\nantoi orjattarensa Silpan Jaakobille vaimoksi,\\nja Lean orjatar Silpa synnytti Jaakobille pojan.\\nLea sanoi: \"Tuokoon hän onnea!\", ja antoi\\npojalle nimeksi Gad. \\nSitten Lean orjatar Silpa\\nsynnytti Jaakobille vielä toisen pojan, \\nja Lea\\nsanoi: \"Miten onnellinen minä olenkaan! Nyt naiset\\nylistävät minua onnelliseksi.\" Ja hän antoi pojalle\\nnimeksi Asser.\\nKerran vehnänleikkuun aikaan Ruuben lähti ulos\\nkävelemään. Hän löysi vainiolta lemmenmarjoja\\nja vei ne äidilleen Lealle. Silloin Raakel sanoi Lealle: \"Anna\\nminullekin poikasi tuomia lemmenmarjoja.\"\\nMutta Lea vastasi hänelle: \"Eikö riitä, että\\nsinä olet jo vienyt minulta mieheni, kun nyt vielä\\ntahdot poikani lemmenmarjat?\" Raakel sanoi: \"Olkoon\\nmenneeksi, Jaakob saa ensi yönä maata sinun\\nkanssasi, kunhan minä saan poikasi lemmenmarjat.\"\\nJa kun Jaakob illalla palasi laitumelta, Lea\\nmeni häntä vastaan ja sanoi: \"Sinun on nyt maattava\\nminun kanssani, sillä minä olen ostanut sinut\\nitselleni poikani löytämillä lemmenmarjoilla.\"\\nJaakob makasi sinä yönä hänen kanssaan. \\nJumala\\nkuuli Lean rukoukset, ja Lea synnytti Jaakobille\\nviidennen pojan. \\nLea sanoi: \"Jumala on korvannut\\nminulle sen, että annoin orjattareni miehelleni.\" Ja\\nhän antoi pojalle nimeksi Isaskar. \\nSitten Lea\\ntuli taas raskaaksi ja synnytti Jaakobille kuudennen\\npojan. \\nLea sanoi: \"Jumala on antanut minulle\\nhyvän lahjan. Nyt mieheni vihdoinkin pysyy minun\\nluonani, sillä olen synnyttänyt hänelle kuusi\\npoikaa.\" Ja hän antoi pojalle nimeksi Sebulon.\\nSen jälkeen Lea synnytti vielä tyttären ja antoi\\nhänelle nimeksi Dina.\\nMutta Jumala muisti myös Raakelia ja kuuli hänen\\nrukouksensa. Hän antoi Raakelin tulla hedelmälliseksi, \\nja Raakel tuli raskaaksi ja synnytti pojan.\\nHän sanoi: \"Jumala on ottanut pois minun häpeäni.\"\\nHän antoi pojalle nimeksi Joosef ja sanoi:\\n\"Antakoon Herra minulle vielä toisen pojan.\"\\nKun Raakel oli synnyttänyt Joosefin, Jaakob\\nsanoi Labanille: \"Salli minun lähteä kotiin, omaan\\nmaahani. \\nAnna minulle vaimoni ja lapseni, joiden\\ntakia olen palvellut sinua, sitten minä lähden.

Minä olen\\ntutkinut ennusmerkkejä ja saanut tietää, että juuri\\nsinun takiasi Herra on siunannut minua.\" \\nJa hän\\nsanoi vielä: \"Määrää itse, paljonko haluat minulta\\npalkkaa, minä kyllä maksan sen.\" \\nJaakob sanoi\\nhänelle: \"Tiedät itsekin, miten minä olen sinua\\npalvellut ja miten sinun karjasi on lisääntynyt\\nminun hoidossani. \\nSe vähä, mitä sinulla oli\\nennen minun tuloani, on kasvanut moninkertaiseksi.\\nMinun askelissani on Herran siunaus tullut\\nsinullekin.

Kun eläimet jälleen olivat\\nkiimoissaan, hän käänsi niiden päät Labanin karjan\\njuovikkaisiin ja mustanruskeisiin eläimiin päin.\\nOmat laumansa hän piti erillään eikä päästänyt niitä\\nsekaantumaan Labanin vuohiin ja lampaisiin. \\nAina\\nkun lauman voimakkaat naaraat tulivat kiimaan,\\nJaakob asetti oksat juottoruuhiin niiden eteen, niin\\nettä ne pariutuivat oksien edessä. \\nMutta heikkojen eläinten eteen hän ei pannut oksia, ja siksi\\njäivät heikot eläimet Labanille ja Jaakob sai\\nvoimakkaat. \\nJaakob rikastui suuresti, ja hänelle\\nkertyi runsaasti lampaita ja vuohia, orjattaria ja\\norjia sekä kameleita ja aaseja.\\nNimi Dan merkitsee \\'hän on tuominnut\\', \\'hän on ratkaissut\\nasian\\'. \\nNimi Naftali muistuttaa heprean sanaa naftulim\\n\\'kamppailu\\'. \\nNimi Gad merkitsee \\'hyvä onni\\'. \\nNimi Asser merkitsee \\'onnekas\\', \\'onnellinen\\'. \\nHedelmällisyyden edistämiseen käytetty kasvi, luultavasti\\nMandragora officinarum. \\nNimi Isaskar muistuttaa heprean sanaa sakar \\'ostaa\\',\\n\\'korvata\\' tai \\'palkka\\'. \\nNimi Sebulon liittyy heprean verbiin zabal \\'hän pysyy\\nluona\\'. \\nNimi Joosef muistuttaa sekä heprean sanaa asaf \\'ottaa pois\\' että sanaa jasaf \\'lisätä\\', \\'antaa lisää\\'. \\nJaakob kuuli Labanin poikien sanovan: \"Jaakob on\\nvienyt kaiken, mikä kuului isällemme, ja hankkinut\\nkoko rikkautensa isämme kustannuksella.\" \\nJaakob\\nnäki myös Labanin kasvoista, ettei tämä enää ollut\\nhänelle yhtä suopea kuin ennen. \\nSilloin Herra\\nsanoi Jaakobille: \"Palaa isiesi maahan ja\\nsynnyinseudullesi. Minä olen sinun kanssasi.\"\\nJaakob kutsutti Raakelin ja Lean luokseen laidunmaalle, missä hän\\npaimensi lampaitaan ja vuohiaan,\\nja sanoi heille: \"Minä huomaan isänne kasvoista,\\nettei hän enää ole minulle yhtä suopea kuin ennen,\\nmutta minun isäni Jumala on aina ollut kanssani.\\nTehän tiedätte, että minä olen parhaani mukaan\\npalvellut isäänne, \\nhän sen sijaan on petkuttanut\\nminua ja muuttanut palkkaani kymmenen kertaa. Jumala\\nei kuitenkaan ole antanut hänen tuottaa minulle\\nvahinkoa. \\nJos isänne sanoi: \\'Täplikkäät saavat\\nolla palkkasi\\', silloin kaikki lampaat ja vuohet\\nsynnyttivät täplikkäitä, ja jos hän sanoi: \\'Juovikkaat saavat\\nolla palkkasi\\', niin kaikki eläimet\\nsynnyttivät juovikkaita. \\nJumala otti karjan pois\\nisältänne ja antoi sen minulle. \\nLampaiden ja\\nvuohien kiima-aikana minä näin unessa juovikkaiden,\\ntäplikkäiden ja laikukkaiden urosten astuvan lampaita ja vuohia. \\nJumalan enkeli sanoi minulle siinä\\nunessa: \\'Jaakob!\\' Ja minä sanoin: \\'Tässä olen.\\'\\nHän sanoi: \\'Näetkö, kaikki urokset, jotka\\nastuvat lampaita ja vuohia, ovat juovikkaita,\\ntäplikkäitä ja laikukkaita, sillä minä olen nähnyt,\\nmiten Laban sinua kohtelee. \\nMinä olen Jumala,\\njoka ilmestyin sinulle Betelissä, missä sinä\\nvoitelit öljyllä patsaan ja teit minulle\\nuhrilupauksen.

Tee siis nyt niin kuin Jumala\\non käskenyt sinun tehdä!\"\\nNiin Jaakob pani lapsensa ja vaimonsa kamelien\\nselkään, \\notti mukaan laumansa ja kaiken omaisuutensa ja koko sen karjan, jonka hän oli hankkinut\\nomakseen Mesopotamiassa, ja lähti Kanaaninmaahan\\nisänsä Iisakin luo. \\nKun Laban oli keritsemässä\\nlampaitaan, Raakel varasti kotoaan isänsä jumalankuvat. \\nJaakob harhautti aramealaista Labania\\neikä kertonut hänelle aikeistaan, \\nvaan lähti\\nsalaa matkaan ja vei mukanaan koko väkensä ja\\nomaisuutensa. Hän ylitti Eufratin ja suuntasi matkansa kohti Gileadin vuoria.\\nKahden päivän kuluttua Laban sai tiedon, että\\nJaakob oli lähtenyt salaa tiehensä. \\nSilloin hän\\notti mukaan sukunsa miehet ja tavoitti Jaakobin\\nseitsemän päivän takaa-ajon jälkeen Gileadin vuorilla. \\nMutta Jumala tuli aramealaisen Labanin luo\\nyöllä unessa ja sanoi hänelle: \"Varo, ettet puhu\\npahasti Jaakobille.\"\\nLaban kohtasi Jaakobin, kun tämä oli leiriytynyt\\nGileadin vuorille, ja myös Laban leiriytyi sinne\\nmiehineen. \\nLaban sanoi Jaakobille: \"Mitä\\noletkaan tehnyt!

Siinä teit kovin tyhmästi! \\nMinä\\nvoisin tehdä teille paljonkin pahaa, mutta teidän\\nisienne Jumala sanoi minulle viime yönä: \\'Varo,\\nettet puhu pahasti Jaakobille.\\' \\nNo hyvä! Sinä\\nlähdit matkaan, koska niin kovasti ikävöit isäsi\\nluo, mutta miksi varastit minulta jumalankuvat?\"\\nJaakob vastasi: \"Minä lähdin salaa, koska pelkäsin,\\nettä sinä riistäisit minulta tyttäresi.\\nMutta kuolema sille, jonka hallusta sinä löydät\\njumalasi!

Lean teltasta tultuaan hän meni Raakelin\\ntelttaan. \\nMutta Raakel oli pannut jumalankuvat\\nkamelin satulasäkkiin ja istui niiden päällä. Laban\\npenkoi koko teltan eikä löytänyt niitä. \\nSilloin\\nRaakel sanoi isälleen: \"Älä vihastu, herrani, vaikka\\nen voikaan nousta tieltäsi. Minulla on se naisten\\ntavallinen vaiva.\" Eikä Laban löytänyt jumalankuvia,\\nvaikka kuinka etsi.\\nSilloin Jaakob kiivastui ja alkoi syyttää\\nLabania. Hän sanoi: \"Mikä on minun rikkomukseni,\\nmitä pahaa minä olen tehnyt, kun näin ryntäät minun\\nperääni? \\nNyt olet penkonut kaikki minun\\ntavarani. Löysitkö mitään itsellesi kuuluvaa? Pane\\nse tähän minun väkeni ja oman väkesi eteen, niin he\\nsaavat ratkaista asian. \\nMinä olen ollut luonasi\\nkaksikymmentä vuotta, eivätkä sinun lampaasi ja\\nvuohesi ole menettäneet karitsoitaan enkä minä ole\\nsyönyt pässejä sinun laumastasi. \\nAina kun toin\\nsinulle pedon raateleman lampaan, jouduin sen\\nkorvaamaan.

Mutta Jumala näki minun\\nahdinkoni ja työni paljouden ja ratkaisi asian viime\\nyönä.\"\\nLaban vastasi Jaakobille: \"Tyttäret ovat kyllä\\nminun tyttäriäni, lapset minun lapsiani ja karja\\nminun karjaani. Kaikki, mitä sinä täällä näet, on\\nminun. Mutta minkä minä nyt mahdan näille tyttärille\\ntai lapsille, jotka he ovat synnyttäneet? \\nTehkäämme siis sovinto, ja olkoon sillä todistaja.\"\\nNiin Jaakob otti kiven, nosti sen pystyyn\\npatsaaksi \\nja sanoi omalle väelleen: \"Kerätkää\\nkiviä.\" Miehet hakivat kiviä ja kasasivat ne\\nröykkiöksi. Sitten he yhdessä aterioivat sen\\nääressä. \\nLaban antoi röykkiölle nimeksi\\nJegarsahaduta, ja Jaakob antoi sille nimen Galed.\\nSitten Laban sanoi: \"Tämä röykkiö olkoon nyt\\nsopimuksemme todisteena.\" Sen vuoksi sitä kutsutaan\\nnimellä Galed \\nja myös nimellä Mispa, sillä hän\\nsanoi vielä: \"Herra pitäköön meitä silmällä\\nsilloinkin, kun emme enää voi nähdä toinen\\ntoistamme. \\nJos sinä kohtelet huonosti tyttäriäni\\nja otat muita vaimoja heidän lisäkseen, niin silloin\\non Jumala oleva sopimuksemme todistajana, vaikka\\nyhtään ihmistä ei olisi läsnä sen todistajana.\"\\nLaban sanoi vielä Jaakobille: \"Katso tätä\\nröykkiötä ja tätä patsasta, jonka minä olen\\npystyttänyt meidän välillemme. \\nTämä röykkiö ja\\ntämä patsas todistavat ja muistuttavat siitä, etten\\nminä saa kulkea niiden ohi pahoin aikein sinua\\nvastaan etkä sinäkään saa kulkea niiden ohi hyökätäksesi minun kimppuuni. \\nMeidän isiemme\\nAbrahamin ja Nahorin Jumala valvokoon tuomarina tätä\\nsopimustamme.\" Jaakob puolestaan vannoi valan sen\\nJumalan kautta, jota hänen isänsä Iisak palveli.\\nSitten Jaakob uhrasi sillä vuorella teurasuhrin\\nja kutsui kaikki muut aterialle kanssaan, ja he\\nsöivät ja viipyivät vuorella sen yön.\\nSekä arameankielinen nimi Jegar-sahaduta että hepreankielinen\\nGaled merkitsevät \\'todistuksen röykkiö\\'. Galed muistuttaa samalla\\nGileadin alueen nimeä. \\nNimi Mispa merkitsee \\'tähystyspaikka\\'. \\nHeti seuraavana aamuna Laban suuteli lapsia ja\\ntyttäriään ja siunasi ja hyvästeli heidät. Sitten\\nhän lähti pois ja palasi kotiseudulleen.\\nJaakob jatkoi matkaansa, ja häntä vastaan tuli\\nJumalan enkeleitä. \\nHeidät nähdessään Jaakob\\nsanoi: \"Tässä on Jumalan etuvartio.\" Niin paikka sai\\nnimekseen Mahanaim.\\nJaakob lähetti sananviejiä edellään veljensä\\nEsaun luo Seirin tienoille Edomin maahan \\nja käski\\nheidän sanoa Esaulle: \"Herrani, näin sanoo\\npalvelijasi Jaakob: \\'Olen asunut Labanin luona ja\\njoutunut viipymään siellä näin kauan. \\nMinulle on\\nkertynyt härkiä ja aaseja, lampaita ja vuohia, orjia\\nja orjattaria, ja lähetän nyt sinulle tämän viestin\\npyytäen, että ottaisit minut suosiollisesti vastaan.\\'\"\\nPalattuaan Jaakobin luo sananviejät kertoivat:\\n\"Kohtasimme veljesi Esaun, ja hän on nyt tulossa\\nsinua vastaan mukanaan neljäsataa miestä.\" \\nJaakob\\npelästyi ja hätääntyi kovin. Hän jakoi väen, joka\\nhänellä oli mukanaan, samoin lampaat ja vuohet,\\nnautakarjan ja kamelit kahdeksi joukoksi, \\nsillä\\nhän ajatteli: \"Jos Esau käy toisen joukon kimppuun\\nja tuhoaa sen, niin toinen joukko pääsee pakoon.\"\\nJaakob sanoi: \"Isäni Abrahamin Jumala ja isäni\\nIisakin Jumala, Herra, sinä joka sanoit minulle:\\n\\'Palaa maahasi ja synnyinseudullesi, niin minä annan\\nsinun menestyä\\'! \\nMinä en ole ansainnut sitä\\nsuurta hyvyyttä ja armoa, jota olet osoittanut minulle,\\npalvelijallesi.

Ja kauppiaat veivät Joosefin\\nEgyptiin.\\nKun Ruuben palasi kaivolle ja huomasi, ettei\\nJoosef ollutkaan siellä, hän repäisi vaatteensa.\\nHän meni veljiensä luo ja sanoi: \"Poika on\\npoissa! Kuinka minun nyt käy?\" \\nMutta veljet\\nottivat Joosefin puvun, teurastivat vuohen ja\\nkastoivat puvun vereen. \\nSitten he veivät sen\\nisälleen ja sanoivat: \"Tämän me löysimme.

Juuda oli Selan syntymän\\naikoihin Kesibissä. \\nJuuda otti esikoiselleen\\nErille vaimon nimeltä Tamar. \\nMutta Er, Juudan\\nesikoinen, oli Herran silmissä kelvoton, ja Herra\\nantoi hänen kuolla. \\nSilloin Juuda sanoi Onanille:\\n\"Makaa veljesi lesken kanssa, täytä velvollisuutesi\\nhänen lankonaan ja herätä eloon veljesi suku.\"\\nMutta Onan tiesi, ettei lasta pidettäisi hänen\\nomanaan, ja aina kun hän makasi kälynsä kanssa, hän\\nantoi siemenensä mennä maahan, ettei antaisi jälkeläisiä veljelleen. \\nHerran silmissä hänen tekonsa\\noli paha, ja siksi Herra antoi hänenkin kuolla.\\nJuuda sanoi silloin miniälleen Tamarille: \"Muuta\\nisäsi taloon ja asu siellä leskenä, kunnes poikani\\nSela on kasvanut aikuiseksi.\" Hän näet pelkäsi, että\\nSelakin kuolisi veljiensä tavoin. Ja Tamar asettui\\nisänsä taloon asumaan.\\nPitkän ajan kuluttua kuoli Suan tytär, Juudan\\nvaimo. Suruajan jälkeen Juuda lähti adullamilaisen\\nystävänsä Hiran kanssa Timnaan lampaiden\\nkeritsiäisiin. \\nKun Tamar sai tietää, että hänen\\nappensa oli menossa Timnaan keritsemään lampaitaan,\\nhän riisui leskenpukunsa, koristautui, peitti\\nkasvonsa hunnulla ja istuutui Enaimin risteykseen\\nTimnan tien varteen. Hän oli näet huomannut, ettei\\nhäntä haluttu antaa Selalle vaimoksi, vaikka tämä\\noli jo aikuinen.\\nJuuda näki Tamarin ja luuli häntä portoksi,\\nkoska Tamar oli peittänyt kasvonsa. \\nHän poikkesi\\nTamarin luo tien sivuun ja sanoi: \"Minä haluan maata\\nkanssasi.\" Hän ei tiennyt, että nainen oli hänen\\nminiänsä. Tamar kysyi: \"Mitä annat minulle siitä,\\nettä saat maata kanssani?\" \\nJuuda vastasi: \"Minä\\nlähetän sinulle vuohen laumastani.\" Tamar sanoi:\\n\"Hyvä on, kunhan annat minulle pantin siihen asti\\nkun lähetät sen.\" \\nJuuda kysyi: \"Mitä minun\\npitäisi antaa sinulle pantiksi?\" Tamar vastasi:\\n\"Sinetti kaulastasi ja tuo sauva, joka sinulla on\\nkädessäsi.\" Juuda antoi ne Tamarille ja makasi hänen\\nkanssaan, ja Tamar tuli hänestä raskaaksi. \\nTamar\\nlähti pois, riisui huntunsa ja pukeutui taas\\nleskenpukuunsa.\\nJuuda lähetti adullamilaisen ystävänsä Hiran\\nviemään vuohen naiselle saadakseen panttinsa\\ntakaisin, mutta tämä ei löytänyt naista. \\nHira\\nkyseli paikkakunnan miehiltä: \"Missä on se\\npyhäkköportto, joka istui Enaimin tienristeyksessä?\"\\nHe vastasivat: \"Ei täällä ole ollut mitään\\npyhäkköporttoa.\" \\nNiin hän palasi Juudan luo ja\\nsanoi: \"Minä en löytänyt sitä naista, ja\\npaikkakunnan miehetkin sanoivat, ettei siellä ole\\nollut mitään pyhäkköporttoa.\" \\nJuuda sanoi:\\n\"Pitäköön nainen sitten pantin, muuten joudumme\\nsuotta naurunalaisiksi.

Niin he\\nolivat jonkin aikaa vankeudessa.\\nVankilassa ollessaan Egyptin kuninkaan juomanlaskija ja leipuri\\nnäkivät molemmat samana yönä unta.  Kumpikin näki eri unen, joka vaati\\noman selityksensä.\\nKun Joosef aamulla tuli heidän luokseen, hän\\ntapasi heidät alakuloisina. \\nHän kysyi näiltä\\nfaraon hovimiehiltä, jotka olivat vankeina hänen\\nkanssaan hänen isäntänsä talossa: \"Miksi te näytätte\\ntänään niin onnettomilta?\" \\nHe vastasivat: \"Olemme nähneet unta, eikä täällä ole ketään, joka\\nselittäisi unemme.\" Joosef sanoi: \"Unien selitykset tulevat Jumalalta,\\nmutta kertokaa kuitenkin unenne minulle.\"\\nYlijuomanlaskija kertoi unensa Joosefille sanoen:\\n\"Näin unta, että edessäni oli viiniköynnös \\nja\\nviiniköynnöksessä oli kolme haaraa. Tuskin se oli\\npuhjennut lehteen, kun se jo kukki, ja rypäleet\\nkypsyivät sen tertuissa. \\nMinulla oli kädessäni faraon malja, ja minä otin rypäleitä, puristin\\nniiden mehun faraon maljaan ja annoin maljan faraon käteen.\"\\nJoosef sanoi hänelle: \"Tämä on unesi\\nselitys. Nuo kolme haaraa tarkoittavat kolmea päivää. \\nKolmen päivän kuluttua farao ylentää sinut\\nja palauttaa sinut entiseen asemaasi, ja sinä saat\\nantaa maljan faraon käteen niin kuin ennenkin, kun\\nolit hänen juomanlaskijansa. \\nÄlä unohda minua,\\nkun sinun käy hyvin, vaan tee minulle palvelus: puhu\\nminusta faraolle ja auta minut pois tästä talosta.\\nMinut on näet ryöstetty tänne heprealaisten\\nmaasta, enkä ole täälläkään tehnyt mitään pahaa.\\nSilti minut on heitetty tähän vankityrmään.\"\\nKun ylileipuri kuuli, miten hyvin Joosef selitti\\nunen, hän sanoi: \"Minun uneni oli tällainen. Minulla\\noli pääni päällä kolme korillista vehnäleipiä.\\nYlimmässä korissa oli kaikenlaisia leivonnaisia\\nfaraolle syötäväksi, mutta linnut söivät ne korista\\npääni päältä.\" \\nJoosef sanoi: \"Tämä on unesi\\nselitys. Nuo kolme koria tarkoittavat kolmea päivää.\\nKolmen päivän kuluttua farao ylentää sinutkin:\\nhän ripustaa sinut hirsipuuhun, ja linnut syövät\\nsinun lihasi.\"\\nKolmantena päivänä faraolla oli syntymäpäivä, ja\\nhän järjesti pidot koko hovinsa väelle. Hän ylensi\\nylijuomanlaskijan ja ylileipurin hovinsa nähden:\\nhän palautti ylijuomanlaskijan entiseen\\nasemaansa, niin että tämä sai taas antaa maljan\\nfaraon käteen, \\nmutta ylileipurin hän hirtätti -juuri niin kuin Joosef oli selittänyt heidän unensa.\\nMutta ylijuomanlaskija ei muistanut Joosefia,\\nvaan unohti hänet.\\nPari vuotta myöhemmin farao näki unen. Hän seisoi\\nNiilin rannalla. \\nYhtäkkiä Niilistä nousi\\nseitsemän kaunista ja lihavaa lehmää, ja ne jäivät\\nsyömään kaislikkoon. \\nNiiden jälkeen Niilistä\\nnousi vielä toiset seitsemän lehmää, rumia ja\\nlaihoja, ja ne jäivät noiden toisten viereen Niilin\\nrannalle. \\nJa rumat ja laihat lehmät söivät ne\\nseitsemän kaunista ja lihavaa lehmää. Siihen farao\\nheräsi. \\nSitten hän nukahti uudestaan ja näki unta\\nvielä toisen kerran. Samassa korressa kasvoi\\nseitsemän paksua ja kaunista tähkää, \\nmutta niiden\\njälkeen puhkesi esiin seitsemän ohutta, itätuulen\\npolttamaa tähkää, \\nja ne nielivät ne seitsemän\\npaksua ja täyteläistä tähkää. Siihen farao heräsi,\\nja hän huomasi, että se oli ollut unta.\\nAamulla farao oli levottomalla mielellä ja\\nkutsutti luokseen Egyptin kaikki enteidenselittäjät\\nja viisaat. Hän kertoi heille unensa, mutta kukaan\\nei osannut selittää niitä hänelle. \\nSilloin\\nylijuomanlaskija sanoi faraolle: \"Minun täytyy nyt\\nottaa puheeksi rikkomukseni. \\nFarao oli kerran\\nvihastunut meihin palvelijoihinsa ja pani minut ja\\nylileipurin vankeuteen henkivartijain päällikön\\ntaloon. \\nSiellä me molemmat näimme eräänä yönä\\nunta, ja kummankin uni vaati oman selityksensä.\\nVankilassa meidän kanssamme oli eräs\\nheprealainen nuorukainen, henkivartijain päällikön\\norja. Me kerroimme hänelle unemme, ja hän selitti ne\\nmeille. \\nJa kävi niin kuin hän oli selittänyt:\\nfarao palautti minut entiseen asemaani, mutta\\nleipurin hän ripusti hirsipuuhun.\"\\nSilloin farao kutsutti Joosefin luokseen. Hänet\\nhaettiin kiireesti vankilasta, hänen partansa ja\\nhiuksensa ajeltiin, ja hän sai ylleen uudet\\nvaatteet. Sitten hän tuli faraon luo. \\nFarao\\nsanoi Joosefille: \"Minä olen nähnyt unen, eikä\\nkukaan osaa sitä selittää, mutta minulle on\\nkerrottu, että sinä pystyt selittämään unen heti sen\\nkuultuasi.\" \\nJoosef vastasi: \"Minä itse en pysty,\\nmutta Jumala voi antaa faraolle suotuisan\\nvastauksen.\"\\nFarao kertoi Joosefille: \"Minä näin unta, että\\nseisoin Niilin rannalla. \\nSilloin Niilistä nousi\\nseitsemän lihavaa ja kaunista lehmää, ja ne jäivät\\nsyömään kaislikkoon. \\nMutta niiden jälkeen\\nNiilistä nousi vielä seitsemän muuta lehmää, jotka\\nolivat niin kurjia, rumia ja laihoja, etten ole\\nsellaisia nähnyt koko Egyptin maassa. \\nNuo rumat\\nja laihat lehmät söivät ne seitsemän ensimmäistä,\\nlihavaa lehmää. \\nMutta vaikka lihavat lehmät\\nkatosivat niiden suihin, ei mistään voinut huomata,\\nettä laihat olivat ahmineet ne sisäänsä, sillä ne\\nnäyttivät yhtä laihoilta ja rumilta kuin ennenkin.\\nSiihen minä heräsin. \\nSitten näin taas unta.\\nSeitsemän täyteläistä ja kaunista tähkää kasvoi\\nsamassa korressa. \\nMutta niiden jälkeen puhkesi\\nesiin seitsemän kuivettunutta, ohutta ja itätuulen\\npolttamaa tähkää. \\nJa nämä ohuet tähkät nielivät\\nne seitsemän kaunista tähkää. Minä olen kertonut\\nuneni enteidenselittäjille, mutta kukaan ei osaa\\nsanoa minulle, mitä ne merkitsevät.\"\\nJoosef sanoi faraolle:\\n\"Faraon unet tarkoittavat samaa. Jumala on kertonut\\nfaraolle, mitä hän aikoo tehdä. \\nNuo seitsemän kaunista lehmää tarkoittavat seitsemää vuotta, ja ne\\nseitsemän kaunista tähkää tarkoittavat samoin seitsemää\\nvuotta. Molempien unien merkitys on sama.\\nNe seitsemän laihaa ja rumaa lehmää, jotka\\nnousivat niiden kauniiden jälkeen, merkitsevät\\nseitsemää vuotta, ja samoin ne seitsemän tyhjää ja\\nitätuulen polttamaa tähkää merkitsevät seitsemää\\nnälkävuotta. \\nKun sanoin, että Jumala on\\nnäyttänyt faraolle, mitä hän aikoo tehdä, tarkoitin\\ntätä: \\nSeuraavat seitsemän vuotta ovat suuren\\nyltäkylläisyyden aikaa koko Egyptin maassa,\\nmutta niitä seuraa seitsemän niin kovaa\\nnälkävuotta, että koko tuo yltäkylläisyys jää\\nEgyptissä unohduksiin. Nälänhätä ulottuu yli koko\\nmaan, \\neikä ruoan runsaudesta ole maassa enää\\ntietoakaan, sillä tuo nälänhätä tulee olemaan hyvin\\nankara. \\nFaraon unen toistuminen taas merkitsee\\nsitä, että Jumala on asian varmasti päättänyt ja\\npanee sen pian täytäntöön.\\n\"Siksi faraon tulisi nyt valita viisas ja\\ntaitava mies Egyptin käskynhaltijaksi. \\nFaraon\\ntulisi myös asettaa maahan virkamiehiä, jotka\\nottavat talteen viidenneksen Egyptin sadosta niinä\\nseitsemänä viljavana vuotena. \\nHeidän tulee koota\\nnoina tulevina hyvinä vuosina talteen kaikkea\\nsyötävää ja varastoida faraon valvonnassa viljaa\\nvarmaan talteen kaupunkeihin. \\nTämä vilja olkoon\\nmaassa varalla niiksi seitsemäksi nälkävuodeksi,\\njotka tulevat Egyptin maahan. Silloin maa ei joudu\\nnälänhädän vuoksi perikatoon.\"\\nNämä sanat miellyttivät faraota ja hänen hovinsa\\nmiehiä, \\nja farao sanoi heille: \"Voisimmeko\\nlöytää toista hänen veroistaan miestä! Hänessä asuu\\nJumalan henki!\" \\nJoosefille hän sanoi: \"Koska\\nJumala on tämän kaiken sinulle ilmoittanut, ei voi\\nolla toista niin viisasta ja taitavaa miestä kuin\\nsinä. \\nSinä saat hallita minun valtakuntaani, ja\\nkoko kansani on totteleva sinun sanaasi. Vain\\nvaltaistuimeni tekee minut sinua korkeammaksi.\"\\nFarao sanoi vielä Joosefille: \"Näin minä asetan\\nsinut hallitsemaan koko Egyptiä.\" \\nJa farao otti\\nsinettisormuksensa sormestaan ja pani sen Joosefin\\nsormeen, puki hänet vaatteisiin, jotka olivat\\nhienointa pellavaa, ja ripusti hänen kaulaansa\\nkultakäädyt. \\nHän antoi Joosefin ajaa toiseksi\\nparhailla vaunuillaan, ja Joosefin edellä huudettiin: \"Abrek!\"\\nNäin hänestä tehtiin koko Egyptin\\nkäskynhaltija. \\nJa farao sanoi Joosefille: \"Minä\\nolen farao, mutta ilman sinun lupaasi älköön kukaan\\nkoko Egyptin maassa ryhtykö mihinkään.\" \\nFarao\\nantoi Joosefille nimeksi Safenat-Paneah ja antoi\\nhänelle vaimoksi Onin\\npapin Poti-Feran tyttären\\nAsenatin. Joosefin valta ulottui yli koko Egyptin.\\nJoosef oli kolmikymmenvuotias tullessaan faraon,\\nEgyptin kuninkaan, palvelukseen. Niin Joosef lähti\\nfaraon luota ja kiersi kaikkialla Egyptissä. \\nJa\\nmaa tuotti seitsemänä yltäkylläisyyden vuotena viljaa ylen määrin. \\nNäiden Egyptin seitsemän hyvän\\nvuoden aikana Joosef keräsi kaikkea syötävää ja\\ntalletti sen kaupunkeihin. Hän varastoi kaupunkeihin\\nkaiken viljan, jonka ympäristön pellot tuottivat.\\nHän varastoi viljaa niin suunnattomat määrät,\\nettä lopulta sitä oli kuin hiekkaa meren rannalla\\neikä sen määrää enää voitu mitata.\\nJoosefille syntyi ennen ensimmäisen nälkävuoden\\ntuloa kaksi poikaa. Heidän äitinsä oli Asenat, Onin\\npapin Poti-Feran tytär. \\nEsikoiselleen Joosef\\nantoi nimeksi Manasse sanoen: \"Jumala on saanut\\nminut unohtamaan\\nkaikki vaivani ja isäni kodin.\"\\nToiselle pojalleen hän antoi nimeksi Efraim\\nsanoen: \"Jumala on tehnyt minut hedelmälliseksi\\nmaassa, jossa olen joutunut niin paljon kärsimään.\"\\nKun Egyptin seitsemän yltäkylläisyyden vuotta\\nolivat kuluneet, \\nalkoi seitsemän nälkävuoden\\naika, kuten Joosef oli ennalta sanonut. Kato tuli\\nkaikkiin muihinkin maihin, mutta Egyptin maassa oli\\ntallella syötävää. \\nKun nälkä alkoi vaivata koko\\nEgyptiä ja kansa huusi faraolta leipää, tämä sanoi\\negyptiläisille: \"Menkää Joosefin luo ja tehkää niin\\nkuin hän käskee.\" \\nKun nälkä jo vallitsi koko\\nmaassa, Joosef avasi viljavarastot ja myi viljaa\\negyptiläisille. Nälänhätä oli Egyptissä ankara.\\nMyös muista maista tultiin Egyptiin Joosefin luo\\nviljaa ostamaan, sillä kaikkialla vallitsi kova\\nnälkä.\\n; 1. Makk. \\nSana abrek merkitsee luultavasti \\'antakaa tietä!\\' tai\\n\\'polvillenne!\\'. \\nOnin kaupunki tunnetaan nykyisin nimellä Heliopolis. \\nNimi Manasse merkitsee \\'hän saa unohtamaan\\'. \\nNimi Efraim muistuttaa heprean sanaa hifra \\'hän on tehnyt hedelmälliseksi\\'. \\nKun Jaakob kuuli, että Egyptistä sai viljaa, hän\\nsanoi pojilleen: \"Mitä te siinä vain katsotte toisianne? \\nOlen kuullut, että Egyptissä on viljaa.\\nMenkää sinne ja ostakaa meille sieltä viljaa, että\\npysyisimme hengissä emmekä menehtyisi.\" \\nNiin kymmenen Joosefin veljeä lähti ostamaan viljaa Egyptistä. \\nMutta Benjaminia, Joosefin täysveljeä, Jaakob\\nei päästänyt toisten mukaan, sillä hän pelkäsi, että\\nBenjaminille voisi sattua jotakin.\\nJaakobin pojat lähtivät yhdessä muiden Egyptiin\\nmenijöiden kanssa viljaa ostamaan, sillä\\nKanaaninmaassa vallitsi nälänhätä. \\nJoosef, joka\\noli Egyptin käskynhaltijana, myi viljaa kaikille\\nihmisille. Niin myös Joosefin veljet tulivat hänen\\neteensä ja lankesivat kasvoilleen maahan.\\nNähdessään veljensä Joosef tunsi heidät, mutta ei\\nollut tuntevinaan. Hän puhutteli heitä ankarasti ja\\nkysyi: \"Mistä te tulette?\" He vastasivat: \"Olemme\\ntulleet Kanaaninmaasta tänne ruokaa ostamaan.\"\\nVaikka Joosef tunsi veljensä, he eivät tunteneet\\nhäntä. \\nSilloin Joosef muisti unet, jotka hän oli nähnyt heistä. Hän sanoi:\\n\"Vakoojia te olette! Olette vain tulleet katsomaan, mistä maahan olisi\\nhelpointa tunkeutua.\"\\nHe vastasivat: \"Emme\\nsuinkaan, herra! Me, sinun palvelijasi, olemme\\ntulleet ostamaan ruokaa. \\nOlemme kaikki saman\\nmiehen poikia, rehellistä väkeä emmekä mitään\\nvakoojia.\" \\nMutta Joosef sanoi: \"Vielä mitä! Te\\nolette tulleet katsomaan, mistä maahan voisi\\ntunkeutua.\" \\nHe sanoivat: \"Meitä, sinun\\npalvelijoitasi, on ollut kaksitoista veljestä,\\nkaikki saman miehen poikia Kanaaninmaasta. Nuorin\\njäi isämme luo, ja yhtä ei enää ole.\" \\nJoosef\\nsanoi: \"Aivan kuten sanoin, vakoojia te olette.\\nJa näin teidät tutkitaan: ellei nuorin veljenne\\ntule tänne, te ette pääse lähtemään täältä, niin\\ntotta kuin farao elää! \\nLähettäkää yksi\\njoukostanne hakemaan veljeänne, te muut jäätte tänne\\nvankeuteen. Sittenhän nähdään, oletteko puhuneet\\ntotta. Ellette näin tee, te olette vakoojia, niin\\ntotta kuin farao elää!\" \\nJa hän heitätti heidät\\nvankilaan kolmeksi päiväksi.\\nKolmantena päivänä Joosef sanoi heille: \"Tehkää\\nkuten sanon, niin saatte pitää henkenne, sillä minä\\nolen Jumalaa pelkäävä mies. \\nVoitte osoittaa rehellisyytenne näin: Yksi teistä jää tänne vankilaan.\\nTe muut saatte mennä ja viedä ostamanne viljan\\nnälkää näkeville perheillenne. \\nTuokaa sitten nuorin veljenne minun luokseni. Näin osoitatte\\npuhuneenne totta, eikä teidän tarvitse kuolla.\"\\nVeljet suostuivat tähän \\nja sanoivat toisilleen:\\n\"Me olemme todellakin ansainneet rangaistuksen\\nsiitä, mitä teimme veljellemme. Me näimme hänen\\nhätänsä, kun hän rukoili meiltä armoa, mutta emme\\nkuunnelleet häntä. Siksi me nyt olemme ahdingossa.\"\\nRuuben sanoi heille: \"Minähän kielsin teitä\\ntekemästä pojalle pahaa, mutta te ette kuunnelleet.\\nNyt joudumme tilille hänen kuolemastaan.\" \\nMutta\\nhe eivät tienneet, että Joosef ymmärsi heidän\\npuheensa, sillä hän puhui heille tulkin\\nvälityksellä. \\nJoosef poistui heidän luotaan ja\\nitki. Palattuaan hän puhui vielä heidän kanssaan,\\notti sitten Simeonin heidän joukostaan ja vangitutti\\nhänet heidän nähtensä.\\nJoosef käski palvelijoittensa täyttää heidän\\nsäkkinsä viljalla, panna kullekin säkkiin hänen\\nmaksamansa hopean ja antaa heille evästä matkaa\\nvarten. \\nHe kuormasivat ostamansa viljan aasien\\nselkään ja lähtivät kotimatkalle.\\nYöpymispaikassa yksi heistä avasi säkkinsä\\nantaakseen viljaa aasilleen ja löysikin säkin suulta\\nhopeansa. \\nHän sanoi veljilleen: \"Minä olen\\nsaanut hopeani takaisin, se on päällimmäisenä minun\\nsäkissäni!\" Silloin he katsoivat toisiaan\\npelästyneinä ja vavisten ja sanoivat: \"Mitä Jumala\\nonkaan tehnyt meille?\"\\nTultuaan isänsä Jaakobin luo Kanaaninmaahan veljekset kertoivat\\nhänelle kaiken, mitä heille oli tapahtunut, ja sanoivat:\\n\"Se mies, joka on maan\\nvaltiaana, puhui meille ankarasti ja väitti meidän\\nvakoilevan maata. \\nMe sanoimme hänelle: \\'Me\\nolemme rehellistä väkeä emmekä mitään vakoojia.\\nMeitä on ollut kaksitoista veljestä, kaikki\\nsaman isän poikia. Yhtä ei enää ole, ja nuorin jäi\\nisämme luo Kanaaninmaahan.\\' \\nSilloin se mies,\\nmaan valtias, sanoi meille: \\'Tällä tavoin minä saan\\ntietää, oletteko rehellisiä: jättäkää yksi\\njoukostanne luokseni, ottakaa mukaanne viljaa nälkää\\nnäkeville perheillenne \\nja menkää hakemaan tänne\\nnuorin veljenne, niin minä uskon, ettette ole\\nvakoojia, vaan rehellistä väkeä. Silloin annan\\nteille takaisin tänne jäävän veljenne, ja te saatte\\nvapaasti liikkua maassa.\\'\"\\nKun he sitten avasivat säkkinsä, jokainen löysi\\nsäkistään oman hopeansa, ja hopean nähdessään he ja\\nheidän isänsä pelästyivät. \\nHeidän isänsä Jaakob\\nsanoi: \"Te olette vieneet minulta lapseni! Joosefia\\nei enää ole, Simeonia ei enää ole, ja nyt aiotte\\nviedä vielä Benjaminin! Minun elämäni on pelkkää\\nsurkeutta!\" \\nSilloin Ruuben sanoi isälleen: \"Saat vaikka tappaa minun kaksi\\npoikaani, ellen tuo Benjaminia takaisin luoksesi! Anna hänet minun\\nhuostaani, minä kyllä tuon hänet sinulle takaisin.\"\\nMutta Jaakob sanoi: \"Minun poikani ei lähde teidän mukaanne. Hänen oma\\nveljensä on kuollut, ja vain hän on enää jäljellä. Jos hänen käy\\nhuonosti matkalla, suru murtaa minut, ja niin te syöksette harmaapään\\nisänne tuonelaan.\"\\nNälänhätä oli Kanaaninmaassa kova. \\nKun\\nEgyptistä tuotu vilja oli loppunut, Jaakob sanoi\\npojilleen: \"Lähtekää jälleen ostamaan meille vähän\\nsyötävää.\" \\nJuuda vastasi: \"Se mies antoi meille\\nankaran määräyksen, ettemme saa astua hänen eteensä,\\nellei veljemme ole mukanamme. \\nMe lähdemme kyllä\\nEgyptiin ostamaan sinulle syötävää, jos annat\\nveljemme tulla mukaan, \\nmutta jos et aio päästää\\nhäntä, me emme lähde sinne, sillä se mies sanoi\\nmeille: \\'Ette saa astua minun eteeni, ellei veljenne\\nole mukananne.\\'\" \\nIsä sanoi: \"Miksi te onnettomat\\nmenitte kertomaan hänelle, että teillä on vielä yksi\\nveli?\" \\nHe vastasivat: \"Se mies uteli kaikenlaista\\nmeistä ja suvustamme ja kysyi: \\'Vieläkö isänne elää?\\nOnko teillä vielä muita veljiä?\\' Me kerroimme\\nhänelle niin kuin asiat ovat. Mistä me saatoimme\\ntietää, että hän käskisi meidän viedä sinne\\nBenjaminin?\"\\nJuuda sanoi isälleen Israelille: \"Päästä poika\\nminun mukaani, niin me lähdemme matkaan. Vain sillä\\ntavoin me voimme kaikki pysyä hengissä, me sekä\\nvaimomme ja lapsemme. \\nMinä otan itse vastatakseni\\nhänestä, minut voit vaatia tilille hänen hengestään.\\nJos en tuo häntä takaisin tänne sinun luoksesi, minä\\nolen aina oleva sinun edessäsi syyllinen.\\nJollemme olisi näin vitkastelleet, olisimme\\nehtineet käydä siellä jo kaksikin kertaa.\"\\nHeidän isänsä Israel sanoi: \"Tehkää sitten niin, mutta ottakaa\\nsäkkeihinne tämän maan parhaita tuotteita ja viekää ne sille miehelle:\\nhiukan balsamia, hiukan hunajaa, suitsuketta ja mirhaa,\\npistaasipähkinöitä ja manteleita.\\nOttakaa mukaanne kaksinkertainen määrä hopeaa, niin että voitte palauttaa\\nsen hopean, joka oli pantu säkkienne suulle. Ehkä se\\noli joutunut sinne vahingossa. \\nOttakaa siis veljenne mukaan ja menkää takaisin. \\nJumala, Kaikkivaltias, auttakoon teitä, kun joudutte sen miehen eteen,\\nniin että hän päästää Simeonin ja myös Benjaminin lähtemään\\nkanssanne. Mutta jos minun täytyy menettää lapseni, käyköön sitten\\nniin.\"\\nMiehet kokosivat lahjansa, ottivat kaksinkertaisen määrän hopeaa ja\\nlähtivät Egyptiin Benjamin mukanaan. Siellä he astuivat Joosefin\\neteen.\\nJoosef näki Benjaminin heidän joukossaan ja\\nsanoi taloutensa hoitajalle: \"Vie nuo miehet minun\\ntalooni, ota karjasta teuras ja valmista se ruoaksi,\\nsillä he aterioivat päivällä minun kanssani.\"\\nMies teki niin kuin Joosef oli käskenyt. \\nKun veljet huomasivat, että heitä vietiin Joosefin taloon, he\\npelästyivät ja sanoivat: \"Meidät on varmaan tuotu tänne sen hopean\\ntakia, joka viime kerralla oli joutunut takaisin säkkeihimme, ja nyt\\nhe kai hyökkäävät kimppuumme, ottavat meidät orjiksi ja vievät\\naasimme.\"\\nKun tultiin talon portille, he menivät Joosefin\\ntaloutta hoitavan miehen luo ja sanoivat hänelle:\\n\"Suo anteeksi, että vaivaamme sinua, herra. Me\\nolemme käyneet täällä kerran aikaisemminkin viljaa\\nostamassa, \\nja kun tulimme yöpymispaikkaan ja\\navasimme säkkimme, jokainen meistä löysi hopeansa\\ntäysimääräisenä säkkinsä suulta. Sen me olemme nyt\\ntuoneet takaisin, \\nja meillä on vielä lisää\\nhopeaa viljan ostamista varten. Emme tiedä, kuka oli\\npannut hopean säkkeihimme.\" \\nTaloudenhoitaja\\nvastasi: \"Olkaa rauhassa, älkää pelätkö. Teidän\\nJumalanne ja isänne Jumala on pannut aarteen\\nsäkkeihinne. Teidän hopeanne minä olen jo saanut.\"\\nJa hän toi Simeonin heidän luokseen.\\nSitten mies vei heidät sisälle taloon, toi\\nheille vettä, että he saivat pestä matkan pölyt\\njaloistaan, ja antoi rehua heidän aaseilleen.\\nOdottaessaan Joosefia, jonka piti saapua\\nkeskipäivällä, he ottivat esiin lahjansa, sillä he\\nolivat kuulleet, että he saisivat aterioida siellä.\\nKun Joosef tuli taloon, he veivät hänelle lahjat\\nja lankesivat maahan hänen eteensä. \\nJoosef\\ntervehti heitä ja kysyi: \"Mitä kuuluu vanhalle\\nisällenne, josta kerroitte minulle? Elääkö hän vielä?\" \\nHe vastasivat: \"Isällemme, sinun\\npalvelijallesi, kuuluu hyvää. Hän on edelleenkin\\nelossa.\" Ja he polvistuivat ja heittäytyivät\\nkasvoilleen.\\nKun Joosef huomasi Benjaminin, oman äitinsä\\npojan, hän kysyi: \"Tämäkö on nuorin veljenne, josta\\nminulle puhuitte?\" Ja hän sanoi: \"Jumala siunatkoon\\nsinua, poika!\" \\nSitten Joosef poistui kiireesti,\\nsillä nähdessään veljensä Benjaminin hän liikuttui\\nniin, että hänen oli vaikea pidättää itkuaan. Hän\\nmeni sisähuoneeseen ja itki siellä. \\nPestyään kasvonsa hän tuli takaisin, pakottautui rauhalliseksi ja\\nsanoi: \"Tuokaa ruoka sisään.\"\\nJa ruokaa tuotiin erikseen hänelle, erikseen veljille ja erikseen\\nniille egyptiläisille, jotka söivät hänen luonaan, sillä egyptiläiset\\neivät aterioi heprealaisten kanssa; se on egyptiläisistä sopimatonta.\\nVeljet\\nsijoitettiin istumaan Joosefia vastapäätä,\\nikäjärjestyksessä, vanhin ensimmäiselle sijalle ja\\nnuorin viimeiselle. Veljekset katselivat ihmeissään\\ntoisiaan. \\nKun sitten Joosef jakoi heille omista\\nruoistaan valitsemiaan paloja, Benjamin sai niitä\\nviisi kertaa enemmän kuin muut veljet. Ja he joivat\\nkaikki yhdessä ja humaltuivat.\\nJoosef sanoi taloutensa hoitajalle: \"Pane noiden miesten säkkeihin\\nsyötävää niin paljon kuin he pystyvät kuljettamaan ja pane kunkin\\nmiehen hopea hänen säkkinsä suuhun.\\nMutta nuorimman miehen säkin\\nsuuhun sinun on pantava minun hopeamaljani ja\\nlisäksi se hopea, joka hänellä oli viljan ostoa\\nvarten.\" Ja mies teki niin kuin Joosef oli käskenyt.\\nAamunkoitteessa miesten annettiin lähteä matkaan\\naaseineen. \\nMutta kun he olivat ehtineet vasta\\nvähän matkan päähän kaupungista, Joosef sanoi\\ntaloutensa hoitajalle: \"Lähde noiden miesten perään,\\nja kun tavoitat heidät, sano heille: \\'Miksi olette\\npalkinneet hyvän pahalla? \\nTeillähän on mukananne\\nse malja, josta herrani juo ja jonka avulla hän\\nnäkee tulevat tapahtumat.

Eihän meille tulisi mieleenkään,\\nettä tekisimme mitään sellaista! \\nSen hopeankin,\\njonka aikaisemmin löysimme säkkiemme suusta, me\\ntoimme sinulle Kanaaninmaasta takaisin.

Poikani Joosef elää! Minä lähden\\nEgyptiin, että saan nähdä hänet ennen kuin kuolen.\"\\nNiin Israel lähti liikkeelle ja otti mukaan kaiken väkensä ja\\nomaisuutensa. Kun hän saapui Beersebaan, hän uhrasi teurasuhreja\\nisänsä Iisakin Jumalalle.\\nYöllä Jumala sanoi Israelille näyssä:\\n\"Jaakob, Jaakob!\" Hän vastasi: \"Tässä olen.\"\\nJumala sanoi: \"Minä olen Jumala, isäsi Jumala.\\nÄlä pelkää lähteä Egyptiin, minä teen sinusta siellä\\nsuuren kansan. \\nMinä itse tulen sinun mukanasi\\nEgyptiin ja tuon sinut sieltä myös takaisin.

Mesopotamiassa Lealle oli syntynyt\\nmyös tytär Dina. Näitä Jaakobin jälkeläisiä, poikia\\nja tyttäriä, oli kolmekymmentäkolme.\\nGadin pojat olivat Sifjon, Haggi, Suni, Esbon,\\nEri, Arodi ja Areli. \\nAsserin pojat olivat Jimna,\\nJisva, Jisvi ja Beria, ja heillä oli sisar Sera.\\nBerian pojat olivat Heber ja Malkiel. \\nNäiden\\nkuudentoista Jaakobin jälkeläisen kantaäiti oli\\nSilpa, jonka Laban oli antanut orjattareksi tyttärelleen Lealle.\\nJaakobin vaimon Raakelin pojat olivat Joosef ja\\nBenjamin. \\nJoosefille syntyivät Egyptissä pojat\\nManasse ja Efraim, ja heidät synnytti Asenat, Onin\\npapin Poti-Feran tytär. \\nBenjaminin pojat olivat\\nBela, Beker, Asbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Ros, Muppim,\\nHuppim ja Ard. \\nNäitä Jaakobille syntyneitä\\njälkeläisiä, joiden kantaäiti oli Raakel, oli\\nneljätoista.\\nDanin poika oli Husim. \\nNaftalin pojat olivat\\nJahseel, Guni, Jeser ja Sillem. \\nNäiden seitsemän\\nJaakobin jälkeläisen kantaäiti oli Bilha, jonka\\nLaban oli antanut orjattareksi tyttärelleen Raakelille.\\nJaakobin jälkeläisiä, jotka tulivat hänen\\nmukanaan Egyptiin, oli kaikkiaan kuusikymmentäkuusi\\nhenkeä, ja vielä lisäksi hänen poikiensa vaimot.\\nJoosefin poikia, jotka olivat syntyneet hänelle Egyptissä, oli\\nkaksi. Näin oli Jaakobin sukuun kuuluvia tullut Egyptiin kaikkiaan\\nseitsemänkymmentä henkeä.\\nJaakob lähetti Juudan edellään Joosefin luo\\nilmoittamaan heidän saapumisestaan Goseniin. Niin he\\ntulivat Gosenin maakuntaan, \\nja Joosef\\nvaljastutti vaununsa ja lähti sinne isäänsä Israelia\\nvastaan. Heti kun hän näki Jaakobin, hän riensi\\nsyleilemään häntä ja itki pitkään hänen olkaansa\\nvasten. \\nIsrael sanoi Joosefille: \"Nyt voin\\nkuolla rauhassa! Olen nähnyt sinut ja tiedän, että\\nsinä olet elossa!\"\\nSitten Joosef sanoi veljilleen ja isänsä koko\\nväelle: \"Nyt minun täytyy palata faraon luo\\nkertomaan, että veljeni ja isäni, jotka asuivat\\nKanaaninmaassa, ovat tulleet luokseni. \\nSanon\\nhänelle, että te olette paimenia, olette aina olleet\\nkarjankasvattajia ja olette nyt tuoneet tänne\\nlampaanne, vuohenne, nautakarjanne ja kaiken muun\\nomaisuutenne. \\nKun sitten farao kutsuu teidät\\nluokseen ja kysyy, mikä teidän ammattinne on,\\nniin sanokaa: \\'Me, sinun palvelijasi, olemme\\nolleet karjankasvattajia nuoruudestamme tähän\\npäivään saakka, kuten esi-isämmekin.\\' Silloin saatte\\njäädä asumaan Goseniin, sillä egyptiläiset eivät\\nsiedä keskuudessaan paimentolaisia, joilla on\\nlampaita ja vuohia.\"\\nJoosef meni faraon luo ja sanoi: \"Isäni ja\\nveljeni ovat tulleet tänne Kanaaninmaasta ja tuoneet\\nmukanaan lampaansa, vuohensa, nautakarjansa ja koko\\nmuun omaisuutensa. He ovat nyt Gosenin maakunnassa.\"\\nSitten hän otti mukaansa viisi veljeään ja vei\\nheidät faraon eteen. \\nFarao kysyi hänen veljiltään: \"Mikä on teidän ammattinne?\" He vastasivat\\nfaraolle: \"Me, sinun palvelijasi, olemme\\nlammaspaimenia, kuten esi-isämmekin olivat.\" \\nHe\\nsanoivat vielä faraolle: \"Me jouduimme tulemaan\\nsiirtolaisiksi tähän maahan, sillä lampaillamme ja\\nvuohillamme ei ole Kanaaninmaassa syötävää, kun\\nsiellä on kova kuivuus. Sallithan, että me, sinun\\npalvelijasi, asetumme asumaan Gosenin maakuntaan.\"\\nFarao sanoi Joosefille: \"Isäsi ja veljesi ovat\\ntulleet luoksesi. \\nEgyptin maa on sinulle avoinna,\\nsijoita heidät asumaan maan parhaaseen osaan. He\\nsaavat asua Gosenin maakunnassa, ja jos heidän\\njoukossaan on kyvykkäitä miehiä, niin pane heidät\\npäällysmiehiksi huolehtimaan minun karjoistani.\"\\nSitten Joosef haki isänsä ja toi hänet faraon\\neteen, ja Jaakob tervehti faraota toivottaen hänelle\\nsiunausta. \\nFarao kysyi Jaakobilta: \"Paljonko sinulla on ikää?\" \\nJaakob vastasi: \"Olen elänyt\\nvaeltajan elämää satakolmekymmentä vuotta.\\nVähälukuiset ja onnettomat ovat elinvuoteni olleet,\\neikä niitä ole kertynyt minulle yhtä paljon kuin\\nesi-isilleni heidän vaelluksensa aikana.\" \\nSitten\\nJaakob hyvästeli faraon, toivotti hänelle siunausta\\nja lähti hänen luotaan.\\nJoosef sijoitti isänsä ja veljensä Egyptiin asumaan ja antoi heille\\nmaaomaisuutta maan parhaasta osasta, Ramseksen maakunnasta, kuten\\nfarao oli käskenyt.\\nJa Joosef piti huolen isänsä ja veljiensä\\nja koko suvun elatuksesta antaen kullekin sen mukaan, montako ruokittavaa hänellä oli.\\nMissään ei ollut syötävää, sillä nälänhätä oli\\nhyvin ankara, ja Egypti ja Kanaaninmaa olivat nääntymässä nälkään. \\nJoosef kokosi Egyptistä ja Kanaaninmaasta kaiken hopean maksuksi siitä viljasta,\\njoka häneltä ostettiin, ja vei hopean faraon palatsiin. \\nKun hopea oli loppunut Egyptistä ja Kanaaninmaasta, tulivat\\negyptiläiset Joosefin luo ja sanoivat: \"Anna meille leipää! Pitääkö\\nmeidän kuolla sinun eteesi, nyt kun hopea on lopussa?\"\\nSilloin\\nJoosef vastasi: \"Tuokaa tänne karjanne, niin minä\\nannan teille syötävää eläimiänne vastaan, jos kerran\\nhopeanne on lopussa.\" \\nHe toivat karjansa Joosefille, ja hän antoi heille syötävää hevosten,\\nlampaiden ja vuohien, nautakarjan ja aasien hinnalla.  Näin hän sinä\\nvuonna piti heidät hengissä ruoalla, jonka he saivat karjaansa\\nvastaan.\\nNiin kului se vuosi. He tulivat hänen luokseen\\nseuraavanakin vuonna ja sanoivat: \"Herramme, sinä\\ntiedät varmaan, että kaikki hopea on lopussa, ja\\nmyös meidän karjamme ja juhtamme ovat jo joutuneet\\nsinun haltuusi. Meillä ei ole sinulle enää muuta\\ntarjottavaa kuin ruumiimme ja peltomme. \\nPitääkö\\nmeidän peltoinemme tuhoutua sinun edessäsi? Ota\\nmeidät ja meidän peltomme ja anna meille leipää,\\nniin me tulemme faraon orjiksi, ja anna meille myös\\nsiemenviljaa. Näin me pysymme hengissä eivätkä pellot autioidu.\"\\nNiin Joosef osti koko Egyptin pellot faraolle,\\nsillä kaikki egyptiläiset myivät hänelle peltonsa,\\nkun nälkä oli käynyt heille ylivoimaiseksi. Näin\\nkoko maa tuli faraon omaksi. \\nJoosef teki\\nkansasta faraon orjia kautta koko Egyptin maan.\\nVain pappien peltoja hän ei ostanut, sillä papit\\nsaivat palkkansa faraolta ja pystyivät elämään\\nhäneltä saamillaan tuloilla. Siksi heidän ei\\ntarvinnut myydä peltojaan.\\nJoosef sanoi kansalle: \"Minä olen nyt ostanut\\nteidät ja teidän peltonne faraolle. Tässä on teille\\nsiemenviljaa, kylväkää peltonne. \\nMutta sadosta\\nteidän on aina annettava viidesosa faraolle. Neljä\\nviidesosaa siitä jääköön teille siemenviljaksi sekä\\nravinnoksi itsellenne, talonväellenne, vaimoillenne\\nja lapsillenne.\" \\nHe sanoivat: \"Sinä olet pitänyt\\nmeidät hengissä. Pidä meistä huolta edelleenkin,\\nniin me olemme faraon orjia.\" \\nJa Joosef sääti\\nlain, joka vielä nytkin on voimassa Egyptissä, että\\nfaraolle oli annettava viidesosa sadosta. Vain\\npappien pellot eivät joutuneet faraon omistukseen.\\nNiin israelilaiset jäivät asumaan Egyptiin Gosenin maakuntaan ja\\nkotiutuivat sinne. He olivat hedelmällisiä ja lisääntyivät runsaasti.\\nJaakob asui Egyptissä seitsemäntoista vuotta, ja hän eli\\nsadanneljänkymmenenseitsemän vuoden ikäiseksi.\\nKun hän, Israel, tunsi kuolemansa lähestyvän,\\nhän kutsui luokseen poikansa Joosefin ja sanoi\\nhänelle: \"Pyydän sinulta erästä asiaa, jolla voit\\nosoittaa minulle rakkautesi ja uskollisuutesi.\\nKosketa minua nivusiin ja vanno, ettet hautaa minua\\nEgyptiin. \\nKun minä olen mennyt lepoon isieni\\nluo, vie minun ruumiini pois Egyptistä ja pane minut\\nisieni hautaan.\" Joosef vastasi: \"Minä teen niin\\nkuin pyydät.\" \\nJaakob sanoi: \"Vanno se minulle.\"  Joosef vannoi, ja sitten Israel\\npolvistui vuoteelleen ja rukoili kasvot päänalusta vasten.\\nJonkin aikaa tämän jälkeen Joosefille\\nilmoitettiin, että hänen isänsä oli sairaana. Joosef\\nlähti hänen luokseen ja otti mukaan molemmat\\npoikansa, Manassen ja Efraimin.\\nKun Jaakob sai tietää, että hänen poikansa Joosef\\noli tullut, hän kokosi voimansa ja nousi istumaan\\nvuoteessa. \\nHän sanoi Joosefille: \"Jumala, Kaikkivaltias, ilmestyi minulle Lusissa\\nKanaaninmaassa, siunasi minut\\nja sanoi minulle: \\'Minä teen sinut\\nhedelmälliseksi ja jälkeläisesi monilukuisiksi, niin\\nettä sinusta saavat alkunsa monet kansat, ja annan\\nsinun jälkeläisillesi tämän maan pysyväksi perintömaaksi.\\' \\nJa nyt sinun kaksi poikaasi, jotka\\nolivat syntyneet Egyptissä jo ennen minun tänne\\ntuloani, ovat minun poikiani.

Se tapahtui Kanaaninmaassa, kun Efrataan\\noli vielä jonkin verran matkaa, ja minä hautasin\\nhänet sinne Efratan tien varteen.\" Efrata on sama\\nkuin Betlehem.\\nHuomatessaan Joosefin pojat Jaakob kysyi: \"Keitä\\nnämä ovat?\" \\nJoosef vastasi: \"He ovat minun\\npoikiani, jotka Jumala on antanut minulle täällä\\nEgyptissä.\" Silloin Jaakob sanoi: \"Tuo heidät tänne,\\nettä saan siunata heidät.\" \\nJaakobin silmät\\nolivat näet käyneet iän mukana heikoiksi, eikä hän\\nenää nähnyt hyvin. Joosef toi pojat hänen luokseen,\\nja hän suuteli ja syleili heitä. \\nJoosefille\\nIsrael sanoi: \"En osannut toivoa, että saisin vielä\\nkerran nähdä kasvosi, ja nyt Jumala on antanut minun\\nnähdä myös sinun poikasi!\" \\nJa Joosef otti pojat\\npois hänen jalkojensa juuresta ja kumartui\\nkasvoilleen maahan saakka.\\nSitten Joosef ohjasi Efraimin oikealla kädellään\\nIsraelin vasemmalle puolelle ja Manassen vasemmalla\\nkädellään Israelin oikealle puolelle ja vei heidät\\nnäin hänen eteensä. \\nIsrael ojensi oikean\\nkätensä, mutta asetti sen Efraimin pään päälle,\\nvaikka tämä oli nuorempi, ja vasemman kätensä hän\\npani Manassen päälle; hän asetti siis kätensä\\nristikkäin. Mutta Manasse oli esikoinen. \\nJa\\nIsrael siunasi Joosefin sanoen:\\n-- Jumala, jonka tahdon mukaisesti\\nminun isäni Abraham ja Iisak ovat vaeltaneet,\\nJumala, joka on ollut minun paimeneni\\nsyntymästäni tähän päivään saakka,\\nse enkeli, joka on minut pelastanut\\nkaikesta onnettomuudesta,\\nsiunatkoon näitä nuorukaisia.\\nHeidän kauttaan säilyköön minun nimeni\\nja minun isieni Abrahamin ja Iisakin nimi.\\nLukuisat olkoot heidän jälkeläisensä maan päällä.\\nKun Joosef näki, että hänen isänsä pani oikean\\nkätensä Efraimin pään päälle, se oli hänestä väärin,\\nja hän tarttui isänsä käteen siirtääkseen sen Manassen pään päälle. \\nHän sanoi isälleen: \"Ei noin,\\nisäni, tämä tässä on esikoinen. Pane oikea kätesi\\nhänen päänsä päälle.\" \\nMutta isä ei suostunut, vaan sanoi: \"Tiedän, poikani, tiedän.

Hän kuoli, ja hänet\\notettiin isiensä luo.\\nNimi Juuda muistuttaa heprean sanaa jodu \\'he ylistävät\\', vrt. \\nNimi Dan merkitsee \\'hän tuomitsee, johtaa, ajaa asiaa\\'. \\nNimi Gad, joka varsinaisesti merkitsee \\'hyvä onni\\', muistuttaa myös\\nheprean sanoja gad \\'ahdistaa\\' ja gedud \\'rosvojoukko\\'.\\nJoosef kumartui itkien isänsä ylle ja suuteli\\nhänen kasvojaan. \\nSitten hän antoi isänsä Israelin\\nbalsamoinnin omien lääkäriensä tehtäväksi, ja he\\nbalsamoivat Israelin ruumiin. \\nBalsamointi kesti\\nneljäkymmentä päivää; se oli tähän työhön tarvittava\\naika. Egyptiläiset surivat häntä seitsemänkymmentä\\npäivää.\\nKun suruaika oli ohi, Joosef sanoi faraon hoviväelle: \"Pyydän teitä\\nkertomaan faraolle,\\nettä\\nisäni vannotti minua sanoen: \\'Minä kuolen pian.\\nHautaa minut omaan hautaani, jonka olen teettänyt\\nitselleni Kanaaninmaassa.\\' Nyt tahtoisin mennä sinne\\nhautaamaan isäni. Sen jälkeen palaan taas tänne.\"\\nFarao vastasi: \"Mene hautaamaan isäsi, niin kuin\\nhän sinua vannotti.\" \\nNiin Joosef lähti hautaamaan\\nisäänsä, ja hänen mukanaan lähtivät kaikki faraon\\nhovimiehet, hänen hovinsa vanhimmat, kaikki Egyptin\\nvanhimmat, \\nJoosefin perhe, kaikki hänen veljensä\\nsekä koko hänen isänsä suku. Vain vaimot ja lapset\\nsekä lampaat, vuohet ja nautakarjan he jättivät\\nGosenin maakuntaan. \\nJoosefilla oli mukanaan myös\\nvaunuja ja ajomiehiä; heitä oli hyvin suuri karavaani.\\nHe tulivat Goren-Atadiin, joka on Jordanin\\ntuolla puolen, ja viettivät siellä suuret ja\\njuhlavat valittajaiset. Surumenot kestivät seitsemän\\npäivää. \\nKun maan kanaanilaiset asukkaat näkivät\\nGoren-Atadin surujuhlan, he sanoivat:\\n\"Egyptiläisillä on siellä mahtavat hautajaiset!\"\\nSiitä tämä paikka sai nimekseen Abel-Misraim.\\nPaikka on Jordanin tuolla puolen.\\nJaakobin pojat tekivät isälleen niin kuin hän\\noli käskenyt: \\nhe veivät hänet Kanaaninmaahan ja\\nhautasivat hänet Mamren lähistölle Makpelan vainion\\nluolaan. Makpelan vainion Abraham oli ostanut\\nsukuhautansa paikaksi heettiläiseltä Efronilta.\\nHaudattuaan isänsä Joosef palasi Egyptiin\\nveljiensä sekä kaikkien muiden kanssa, jotka olivat\\nolleet hänen mukanaan.\\nJoosefin veljet alkoivat isänsä kuoltua pelätä\\nja sanoivat toisilleen: \"Entäpä jos Joosef nyt\\nkääntyy meitä vastaan ja sittenkin kostaa meille\\nkaiken sen pahan, minkä me hänelle teimme?\" \\nJa\\nhe lähettivät Joosefille sanan: \"Ennen kuolemaansa\\nisämme käski meitä \\nsanomaan sinulle näin: \\'Anna\\nveljillesi anteeksi heidän rikoksensa ja pahat\\ntekonsa.

Et la lumière fut.\\nDieu vit que la lumière était bonne; et Dieu sépara la lumière d\\'avec les ténèbres.\\nDieu appela la lumière jour, et il appela les ténèbres nuit. Ainsi, il y eut un soir, et il y eut un matin: ce fut le premier jour.\\nDieu dit: Qu\\'il y ait une étendue entre les eaux, et qu\\'elle sépare les eaux d\\'avec les eaux.\\nEt Dieu fit l\\'étendue, et il sépara les eaux qui sont au-dessous de l\\'étendue d\\'avec les eaux qui sont au-dessus de l\\'étendue. Et cela fut ainsi.\\nDieu appela l\\'étendue ciel. Ainsi, il y eut un soir, et il y eut un matin: ce fut le second jour.\\nDieu dit: Que les eaux qui sont au-dessous du ciel se rassemblent en un seul lieu, et que le sec paraisse. Et cela fut ainsi.\\nDieu appela le sec terre, et il appela l\\'amas des eaux mers. Dieu vit que cela était bon.\\nPuis Dieu dit: Que la terre produise de la verdure, de l\\'herbe portant de la semence, des arbres fruitiers donnant du fruit selon leur espèce et ayant en eux leur semence sur la terre. Et cela fut ainsi.\\nLa terre produisit de la verdure, de l\\'herbe portant de la semence selon son espèce, et des arbres donnant du fruit et ayant en eux leur semence selon leur espèce. Dieu vit que cela était bon.\\nAinsi, il y eut un soir, et il y eut un matin: ce fut le troisième jour.\\nDieu dit: Qu\\'il y ait des luminaires dans l\\'étendue du ciel, pour séparer le jour d\\'avec la nuit; que ce soient des signes pour marquer les époques, les jours et les années;\\net qu\\'ils servent de luminaires dans l\\'étendue du ciel, pour éclairer la terre. Et cela fut ainsi.\\nDieu fit les deux grands luminaires, le plus grand luminaire pour présider au jour, et le plus petit luminaire pour présider à la nuit; il fit aussi les étoiles.\\nDieu les plaça dans l\\'étendue du ciel, pour éclairer la terre,\\npour présider au jour et à la nuit, et pour séparer la lumière d\\'avec les ténèbres. Dieu vit que cela était bon.\\nAinsi, il y eut un soir, et il y eut un matin: ce fut le quatrième jour.\\nDieu dit: Que les eaux produisent en abondance des animaux vivants, et que des oiseaux volent sur la terre vers l\\'étendue du ciel.\\nDieu créa les grands poissons et tous les animaux vivants qui se meuvent, et que les eaux produisirent en abondance selon leur espèce; il créa aussi tout oiseau ailé selon son espèce. Dieu vit que cela était bon.\\nDieu les bénit, en disant: Soyez féconds, multipliez, et remplissez les eaux des mers; et que les oiseaux multiplient sur la terre.\\nAinsi, il y eut un soir, et il y eut un matin: ce fut le cinquième jour.\\nDieu dit: Que la terre produise des animaux vivants selon leur espèce, du bétail, des reptiles et des animaux terrestres, selon leur espèce. Et cela fut ainsi.\\nDieu fit les animaux de la terre selon leur espèce, le bétail selon son espèce, et tous les reptiles de la terre selon leur espèce. Dieu vit que cela était bon.\\nPuis Dieu dit: Faisons l\\'homme à notre image, selon notre ressemblance, et qu\\'il domine sur les poissons de la mer, sur les oiseaux du ciel, sur le bétail, sur toute la terre, et sur tous les reptiles qui rampent sur la terre.\\nDieu créa l\\'homme à son image, il le créa à l\\'image de Dieu, il créa l\\'homme et la femme.\\nDieu les bénit, et Dieu leur dit: Soyez féconds, multipliez, remplissez la terre, et l\\'assujettissez; et dominez sur les poissons de la mer, sur les oiseaux du ciel, et sur tout animal qui se meut sur la terre.\\nEt Dieu dit: Voici, je vous donne toute herbe portant de la semence et qui est à la surface de toute la terre, et tout arbre ayant en lui du fruit d\\'arbre et portant de la semence: ce sera votre nourriture.\\nEt à tout animal de la terre, à tout oiseau du ciel, et à tout ce qui se meut sur la terre, ayant en soi un souffle de vie, je donne toute herbe verte pour nourriture. Et cela fut ainsi.\\nDieu vit tout ce qu\\'il avait fait et voici, cela était très bon. Ainsi, il y eut un soir, et il y eut un matin: ce fut le sixième jour.\\nAinsi furent achevés les cieux et la terre, et toute leur armée.\\nDieu acheva au septième jour son oeuvre, qu\\'il avait faite: et il se reposa au septième jour de toute son oeuvre, qu\\'il avait faite.\\nDieu bénit le septième jour, et il le sanctifia, parce qu\\'en ce jour il se reposa de toute son oeuvre qu\\'il avait créée en la faisant.\\nVoici les origines des cieux et de la terre, quand ils furent créés.\\nLorsque l\\'éternel Dieu fit une terre et des cieux, aucun arbuste des champs n\\'était encore sur la terre, et aucune herbe des champs ne germait encore: car l\\'éternel Dieu n\\'avait pas fait pleuvoir sur la terre, et il n\\'y avait point d\\'homme pour cultiver le sol.\\nMais une vapeur s\\'éleva de la terre, et arrosa toute la surface du sol.\\nL\\'éternel Dieu forma l\\'homme de la poussière de la terre, il souffla dans ses narines un souffle de vie et l\\'homme devint un être vivant.\\nPuis l\\'éternel Dieu planta un jardin en éden, du côté de l\\'orient, et il y mit l\\'homme qu\\'il avait formé.\\nL\\'éternel Dieu fit pousser du sol des arbres de toute espèce, agréables à voir et bons à manger, et l\\'arbre de la vie au milieu du jardin, et l\\'arbre de la connaissance du bien et du mal.\\nUn fleuve sortait d\\'éden pour arroser le jardin, et de là il se divisait en quatre bras.\\nLe nom du premier est Pischon; c\\'est celui qui entoure tout le pays de Havila, où se trouve l\\'or.\\nL\\'or de ce pays est pur; on y trouve aussi le bdellium et la pierre d\\'onyx.\\nLe nom du second fleuve est Guihon; c\\'est celui qui entoure tout le pays de Cusch.\\nLe nom du troisième est Hiddékel; c\\'est celui qui coule à l\\'orient de l\\'Assyrie. Le quatrième fleuve, c\\'est l\\'Euphrate.\\nL\\'éternel Dieu prit l\\'homme, et le plaça dans le jardin d\\'éden pour le cultiver et pour le garder.\\nL\\'éternel Dieu donna cet ordre à l\\'homme: Tu pourras manger de tous les arbres du jardin;\\nmais tu ne mangeras pas de l\\'arbre de la connaissance du bien et du mal, car le jour où tu en mangeras, tu mourras.\\nL\\'éternel Dieu dit: Il n\\'est pas bon que l\\'homme soit seul; je lui ferai une aide semblable à lui.\\nL\\'éternel Dieu forma de la terre tous les animaux des champs et tous les oiseaux du ciel, et il les fit venir vers l\\'homme, pour voir comment il les appellerait, et afin que tout être vivant portât le nom que lui donnerait l\\'homme.\\nEt l\\'homme donna des noms à tout le bétail, aux oiseaux du ciel et à tous les animaux des champs; mais, pour l\\'homme, il ne trouva point d\\'aide semblable à lui.\\nAlors l\\'éternel Dieu fit tomber un profond sommeil sur l\\'homme, qui s\\'endormit; il prit une de ses côtes, et referma la chair à sa place.\\nL\\'éternel Dieu forma une femme de la côte qu\\'il avait prise de l\\'homme, et il l\\'amena vers l\\'homme.\\nEt l\\'homme dit: Voici cette fois celle qui est os de mes os et chair de ma chair! on l\\'appellera femme, parce qu\\'elle a été prise de l\\'homme.\\nC\\'est pourquoi l\\'homme quittera son père et sa mère, et s\\'attachera à sa femme, et ils deviendront une seule chair.\\nL\\'homme et sa femme étaient tous deux nus, et ils n\\'en avaient point honte.\\nLe serpent était le plus rusé de tous les animaux des champs, que l\\'éternel Dieu avait faits. Il dit à la femme: Dieu a-t-il réellement dit: Vous ne mangerez pas de tous les arbres du jardin?\\nLa femme répondit au serpent: Nous mangeons du fruit des arbres du jardin.\\nMais quant au fruit de l\\'arbre qui est au milieu du jardin, Dieu a dit: Vous n\\'en mangerez point et vous n\\'y toucherez point, de peur que vous ne mouriez.\\nAlors le serpent dit à la femme: Vous ne mourrez point;\\nmais Dieu sait que, le jour où vous en mangerez, vos yeux s\\'ouvriront, et que vous serez comme des dieux, connaissant le bien et le mal.\\nLa femme vit que l\\'arbre était bon à manger et agréable à la vue, et qu\\'il était précieux pour ouvrir l\\'intelligence; elle prit de son fruit, et en mangea; elle en donna aussi à son mari, qui était auprès d\\'elle, et il en mangea.\\nLes yeux de l\\'un et de l\\'autre s\\'ouvrirent, ils connurent qu\\'ils étaient nus, et ayant cousu des feuilles de figuier, ils s\\'en firent des ceintures.\\nAlors ils entendirent la voix de l\\'éternel Dieu, qui parcourait le jardin vers le soir, et l\\'homme et sa femme se cachèrent loin de la face de l\\'éternel Dieu, au milieu des arbres du jardin.\\nMais l\\'éternel Dieu appela l\\'homme, et lui dit: Où es-tu?\\nIl répondit: J\\'ai entendu ta voix dans le jardin, et j\\'ai eu peur, parce que je suis nu, et je me suis caché.\\nEt l\\'éternel Dieu dit: Qui t\\'a appris que tu es nu? Est-ce que tu as mangé de l\\'arbre dont je t\\'avais défendu de manger?\\nL\\'homme répondit: La femme que tu as mise auprès de moi m\\'a donné de l\\'arbre, et j\\'en ai mangé.\\nEt l\\'éternel Dieu dit à la femme: Pourquoi as-tu fait cela? La femme répondit: Le serpent m\\'a séduite, et j\\'en ai mangé.\\nL\\'éternel Dieu dit au serpent: Puisque tu as fait cela, tu seras maudit entre tout le bétail et entre tous les animaux des champs, tu marcheras sur ton ventre, et tu mangeras de la poussière tous les jours de ta vie.\\nJe mettrai inimitié entre toi et la femme, entre ta postérité et sa postérité: celle-ci t\\'écrasera la tête, et tu lui blesseras le talon.\\nIl dit à la femme: J\\'augmenterai la souffrance de tes grossesses, tu enfanteras avec douleur, et tes désirs se porteront vers ton mari, mais il dominera sur toi.\\nIl dit à l\\'homme: Puisque tu as écouté la voix de ta femme, et que tu as mangé de l\\'arbre au sujet duquel je t\\'avais donné cet ordre: Tu n\\'en mangeras point! le sol sera maudit à cause de toi. C\\'est à force de peine que tu en tireras ta nourriture tous les jours de ta vie,\\nil te produira des épines et des ronces, et tu mangeras de l\\'herbe des champs.\\nC\\'est à la sueur de ton visage que tu mangeras du pain, jusqu\\'à ce que tu retournes dans la terre, d\\'où tu as été pris; car tu es poussière, et tu retourneras dans la poussière.\\nAdam donna à sa femme le nom d\\'Eve: car elle a été la mère de tous les vivants.\\nL\\'éternel Dieu fit à Adam et à sa femme des habits de peau, et il les en revêtit.\\nL\\'éternel Dieu dit: Voici, l\\'homme est devenu comme l\\'un de nous, pour la connaissance du bien et du mal. Empêchons-le maintenant d\\'avancer sa main, de prendre de l\\'arbre de vie, d\\'en manger, et de vivre éternellement.\\nEt l\\'éternel Dieu le chassa du jardin d\\'éden, pour qu\\'il cultivât la terre, d\\'où il avait été pris.\\nC\\'est ainsi qu\\'il chassa Adam; et il mit à l\\'orient du jardin d\\'éden les chérubins qui agitent une épée flamboyante, pour garder le chemin de l\\'arbre de vie.\\nAdam connut Eve, sa femme; elle conçut, et enfanta Caïn et elle dit: J\\'ai formé un homme avec l\\'aide de l\\'éternel.\\nElle enfanta encore son frère Abel. Abel fut berger, et Caïn fut laboureur.\\nAu bout de quelque temps, Caïn fit à l\\'éternel une offrande des fruits de la terre;\\net Abel, de son côté, en fit une des premiers-nés de son troupeau et de leur graisse. L\\'éternel porta un regard favorable sur Abel et sur son offrande;\\nmais il ne porta pas un regard favorable sur Caïn et sur son offrande. Caïn fut très irrité, et son visage fut abattu.\\nEt l\\'éternel dit à Caïn: Pourquoi es-tu irrité, et pourquoi ton visage est-il abattu?\\nCertainement, si tu agis bien, tu relèveras ton visage, et si tu agis mal, le péché se couche à la porte, et ses désirs se portent vers toi: mais toi, domine sur lui.\\nCependant, Caïn adressa la parole à son frère Abel; mais, comme ils étaient dans les champs, Caïn se jeta sur son frère Abel, et le tua.\\nL\\'éternel dit à Caïn: Où est ton frère Abel? Il répondit: Je ne sais pas; suis-je le gardien de mon frère?\\nEt Dieu dit: Qu\\'as-tu fait? La voix du sang de ton frère crie de la terre jusqu\\'à moi.\\nMaintenant, tu seras maudit de la terre qui a ouvert sa bouche pour recevoir de ta main le sang de ton frère.\\nQuand tu cultiveras le sol, il ne te donnera plus sa richesse. Tu seras errant et vagabond sur la terre.\\nCaïn dit à l\\'éternel: Mon châtiment est trop grand pour être supporté.\\nVoici, tu me chasses aujourd\\'hui de cette terre; je serai caché loin de ta face, je serai errant et vagabond sur la terre, et quiconque me trouvera me tuera.\\nL\\'éternel lui dit: Si quelqu\\'un tuait Caïn, Caïn serait vengé sept fois. Et l\\'éternel mit un signe sur Caïn pour que quiconque le trouverait ne le tuât point.\\nPuis, Caïn s\\'éloigna de la face de l\\'éternel, et habita dans la terre de Nod, à l\\'orient d\\'éden.\\nCaïn connut sa femme; elle conçut, et enfanta Hénoc. Il bâtit ensuite une ville, et il donna à cette ville le nom de son fils Hénoc.\\nHénoc engendra Irad, Irad engendra Mehujaël, Mehujaël engendra Metuschaël, et Metuschaël engendra Lémec.\\nLémec prit deux femmes: le nom de l\\'une était Ada, et le nom de l\\'autre Tsilla.\\nAda enfanta Jabal: il fut le père de ceux qui habitent sous des tentes et près des troupeaux.\\nLe nom de son frère était Jubal: il fut le père de tous ceux qui jouent de la harpe et du chalumeau.\\nTsilla, de son côté, enfanta Tubal Caïn, qui forgeait tous les instruments d\\'airain et de fer. La soeur de Tubal Caïn était Naama.\\nLémec dit à ses femmes: Ada et Tsilla, écoutez ma voix! Femmes de Lémec, écoutez ma parole! J\\'ai tué un homme pour ma blessure, Et un jeune homme pour ma meurtrissure.\\nCaïn sera vengé sept fois, Et Lémec soixante-dix-sept fois.\\nAdam connut encore sa femme; elle enfanta un fils, et l\\'appela du nom de Seth, car, dit-elle, Dieu m\\'a donnée un autre fils à la place d\\'Abel, que Caïn a tué.\\nSeth eut aussi un fils, et il l\\'appela du nom d\\'énosch. C\\'est alors que l\\'on commença à invoquer le nom de l\\'éternel.\\nVoici le livre de la postérité d\\'Adam. Lorsque Dieu créa l\\'homme, il le fit à la ressemblance de Dieu.\\nIl créa l\\'homme et la femme, il les bénit, et il les appela du nom d\\'homme, lorsqu\\'ils furent créés.\\nAdam, âgé de cent trente ans, engendra un fils à sa ressemblance, selon son image, et il lui donna le nom de Seth.\\nLes jours d\\'Adam, après la naissance de Seth, furent de huit cents ans; et il engendra des fils et des filles.\\nTous les jours qu\\'Adam vécut furent de neuf cent trente ans; puis il mourut.\\nSeth, âgé de cent cinq ans, engendra énosch.\\nSeth vécut, après la naissance d\\'énosch, huit cent sept ans; et il engendra des fils et des filles.\\nTous les jours de Seth furent de neuf cent douze ans; puis il mourut.\\nénosch, âgé de quatre-vingt-dix ans, engendra Kénan.\\nénosch vécut, après la naissance de Kénan, huit cent quinze ans; et il engendra des fils et des filles.\\nTous les jours d\\'énosch furent de neuf cent cinq ans; puis il mourut.\\nKénan, âgé de soixante-dix ans, engendra Mahalaleel.\\nKénan vécut, après la naissance de Mahalaleel, huit cent quarante ans; et il engendra des fils et des filles.\\nTous les jours de Kénan furent de neuf cent dix ans; puis il mourut.\\nMahalaleel, âgé de soixante-cinq ans, engendra Jéred.\\nMahalaleel vécut, après la naissance de Jéred, huit cent trente ans; et il engendra des fils et des filles.\\nTous les jours de Mahalaleel furent de huit cent quatre-vingt-quinze ans; puis il mourut.\\nJéred, âgé de cent soixante-deux ans, engendra Hénoc.\\nJéred vécut, après la naissance d\\'Hénoc, huit cents ans; et il engendra des fils et des filles.\\nTous les jours de Jéred furent de neuf cent soixante-deux ans; puis il mourut.\\nHénoc, âgé de soixante-cinq ans, engendra Metuschélah.\\nHénoc, après la naissance de Metuschélah, marcha avec Dieu trois cents ans; et il engendra des fils et des filles.\\nTous les jours d\\'Hénoc furent de trois cent soixante-cinq ans.\\nHénoc marcha avec Dieu; puis il ne fut plus, parce que Dieu le prit.\\nMetuschélah, âgé de cent quatre-vingt-sept ans, engendra Lémec.\\nMetuschélah vécut, après la naissance de Lémec, sept cent quatre-vingt deux ans; et il engendra des fils et des filles.\\nTous les jours de Metuschélah furent de neuf cent soixante-neuf ans; puis il mourut.\\nLémec, âgé de cent quatre-vingt-deux ans, engendra un fils.\\nIl lui donna le nom de Noé, en disant: Celui-ci nous consolera de nos fatigues et du travail pénible de nos mains, provenant de cette terre que l\\'éternel a maudite.\\nLémec vécut, après la naissance de Noé, cinq cent quatre-vingt-quinze ans; et il engendra des fils et des filles.\\nTous les jours de Lémec furent de sept cent soixante-dix sept ans; puis il mourut.\\nNoé, âgé de cinq cents ans, engendra Sem, Cham et Japhet.\\nLorsque les hommes eurent commencé à se multiplier sur la face de la terre, et que des filles leur furent nées,\\nles fils de Dieu virent que les filles des hommes étaient belles, et ils en prirent pour femmes parmi toutes celles qu\\'ils choisirent.\\nAlors l\\'éternel dit: Mon esprit ne restera pas à toujours dans l\\'homme, car l\\'homme n\\'est que chair, et ses jours seront de cent vingt ans.\\nLes géants étaient sur la terre en ces temps-là, après que les fils de Dieu furent venus vers les filles des hommes, et qu\\'elles leur eurent donné des enfants: ce sont ces héros qui furent fameux dans l\\'antiquité.\\nL\\'éternel vit que la méchanceté des hommes était grande sur la terre, et que toutes les pensées de leur coeur se portaient chaque jour uniquement vers le mal.\\nL\\'éternel se repentit d\\'avoir fait l\\'homme sur la terre, et il fut affligé en son coeur.\\nEt l\\'éternel dit: J\\'exterminerai de la face de la terre l\\'homme que j\\'ai créé, depuis l\\'homme jusqu\\'au bétail, aux reptiles, et aux oiseaux du ciel; car je me repens de les avoir faits.\\nMais Noé trouva grâce aux yeux de l\\'éternel.\\nVoici la postérité de Noé. Noé était un homme juste et intègre dans son temps; Noé marchait avec Dieu.\\nNoé engendra trois fils: Sem, Cham et Japhet.\\nLa terre était corrompue devant Dieu, la terre était pleine de violence.\\nDieu regarda la terre, et voici, elle était corrompue; car toute chair avait corrompu sa voie sur la terre.\\nAlors Dieu dit à Noé: La fin de toute chair est arrêtée par devers moi; car ils ont rempli la terre de violence; voici, je vais les détruire avec la terre.\\nFais-toi une arche de bois de gopher; tu disposeras cette arche en cellules, et tu l\\'enduiras de poix en dedans et en dehors.\\nVoici comment tu la feras: l\\'arche aura trois cents coudées de longueur, cinquante coudées de largeur et trente coudées de hauteur.\\nTu feras à l\\'arche une fenêtre, que tu réduiras à une coudée en haut; tu établiras une porte sur le côté de l\\'arche; et tu construiras un étage inférieur, un second et un troisième.\\nEt moi, je vais faire venir le déluge d\\'eaux sur la terre, pour détruire toute chair ayant souffle de vie sous le ciel; tout ce qui est sur la terre périra.\\nMais j\\'établis mon alliance avec toi; tu entreras dans l\\'arche, toi et tes fils, ta femme et les femmes de tes fils avec toi.\\nDe tout ce qui vit, de toute chair, tu feras entrer dans l\\'arche deux de chaque espèce, pour les conserver en vie avec toi: il y aura un mâle et une femelle.\\nDes oiseaux selon leur espèce, du bétail selon son espèce, et de tous les reptiles de la terre selon leur espèce, deux de chaque espèce viendront vers toi, pour que tu leur conserves la vie.\\nEt toi, prends de tous les aliments que l\\'on mange, et fais-en une provision auprès de toi, afin qu\\'ils te servent de nourriture ainsi qu\\'à eux.\\nC\\'est ce que fit Noé: il exécuta tout ce que Dieu lui avait ordonné.\\nL\\'éternel dit à Noé: Entre dans l\\'arche, toi et toute ta maison; car je t\\'ai vu juste devant moi parmi cette génération.\\nTu prendras auprès de toi sept couples de tous les animaux purs, le mâle et sa femelle; une paire des animaux qui ne sont pas purs, le mâle et sa femelle;\\nsept couples aussi des oiseaux du ciel, mâle et femelle, afin de conserver leur race en vie sur la face de toute la terre.\\nCar, encore sept jours, et je ferai pleuvoir sur la terre quarante jours et quarante nuits, et j\\'exterminerai de la face de la terre tous les êtres que j\\'ai faits.\\nNoé exécuta tout ce que l\\'éternel lui avait ordonné.\\nNoé avait six cents ans, lorsque le déluge d\\'eaux fut sur la terre.\\nEt Noé entra dans l\\'arche avec ses fils, sa femme et les femmes de ses fils, pour échapper aux eaux du déluge.\\nD\\'entre les animaux purs et les animaux qui ne sont pas purs, les oiseaux et tout ce qui se meut sur la terre,\\nil entra dans l\\'arche auprès de Noé, deux à deux, un mâle et une femelle, comme Dieu l\\'avait ordonné à Noé.\\nSept jours après, les eaux du déluge furent sur la terre.\\nL\\'an six cent de la vie de Noé, le second mois, le dix-septième jour du mois, en ce jour-là toutes les sources du grand abîme jaillirent, et les écluses des cieux s\\'ouvrirent.\\nLa pluie tomba sur la terre quarante jours et quarante nuits.\\nCe même jour entrèrent dans l\\'arche Noé, Sem, Cham et Japhet, fils de Noé, la femme de Noé et les trois femmes de ses fils avec eux:\\neux, et tous les animaux selon leur espèce, tout le bétail selon son espèce, tous les reptiles qui rampent sur la terre selon leur espèce, tous les oiseaux selon leur espèce, tous les petits oiseaux, tout ce qui a des ailes.\\nIls entrèrent dans l\\'arche auprès de Noé, deux à deux, de toute chair ayant souffle de vie.\\nIl en entra, mâle et femelle, de toute chair, comme Dieu l\\'avait ordonné à Noé. Puis l\\'éternel ferma la porte sur lui.\\nLe déluge fut quarante jours sur la terre. Les eaux crûrent et soulevèrent l\\'arche, et elle s\\'éleva au-dessus de la terre.\\nLes eaux grossirent et s\\'accrurent beaucoup sur la terre, et l\\'arche flotta sur la surface des eaux.\\nLes eaux grossirent de plus en plus, et toutes les hautes montagnes qui sont sous le ciel entier furent couvertes.\\nLes eaux s\\'élevèrent de quinze coudées au-dessus des montagnes, qui furent couvertes.\\nTout ce qui se mouvait sur la terre périt, tant les oiseaux que le bétail et les animaux, tout ce qui rampait sur la terre, et tous les hommes.\\nTout ce qui avait respiration, souffle de vie dans ses narines, et qui était sur la terre sèche, mourut.\\nTous les êtres qui étaient sur la face de la terre furent exterminés, depuis l\\'homme jusqu\\'au bétail, aux reptiles et aux oiseaux du ciel: ils furent exterminés de la terre. Il ne resta que Noé, et ce qui était avec lui dans l\\'arche.\\nLes eaux furent grosses sur la terre pendant cent cinquante jours.\\nDieu se souvint de Noé, de tous les animaux et de tout le bétail qui étaient avec lui dans l\\'arche; et Dieu fit passer un vent sur la terre, et les eaux s\\'apaisèrent.\\nLes sources de l\\'abîme et les écluses des cieux furent fermées, et la pluie ne tomba plus du ciel.\\nLes eaux se retirèrent de dessus la terre, s\\'en allant et s\\'éloignant, et les eaux diminuèrent au bout de cent cinquante jours.\\nLe septième mois, le dix-septième jour du mois, l\\'arche s\\'arrêta sur les montagnes d\\'Ararat.\\nLes eaux allèrent en diminuant jusqu\\'au dixième mois. Le dixième mois, le premier jour du mois, apparurent les sommets des montagnes.\\nAu bout de quarante jours, Noé ouvrit la fenêtre qu\\'il avait faite à l\\'arche.\\nIl lâcha le corbeau, qui sortit, partant et revenant, jusqu\\'à ce que les eaux eussent séché sur la terre.\\nIl lâcha aussi la colombe, pour voir si les eaux avaient diminué à la surface de la terre.\\nMais la colombe ne trouva aucun lieu pour poser la plante de son pied, et elle revint à lui dans l\\'arche, car il y avait des eaux à la surface de toute la terre. Il avança la main, la prit, et la fit rentrer auprès de lui dans l\\'arche.\\nIl attendit encore sept autres jours, et il lâcha de nouveau la colombe hors de l\\'arche.\\nLa colombe revint à lui sur le soir; et voici, une feuille d\\'olivier arrachée était dans son bec. Noé connut ainsi que les eaux avaient diminué sur la terre.\\nIl attendit encore sept autres jours; et il lâcha la colombe. Mais elle ne revint plus à lui.\\nL\\'an six cent un, le premier mois, le premier jour du mois, les eaux avaient séché sur la terre. Noé ôta la couverture de l\\'arche: il regarda, et voici, la surface de la terre avait séché.\\nLe second mois, le vingt-septième jour du mois, la terre fut sèche.\\nAlors Dieu parla à Noé, en disant:\\nSors de l\\'arche, toi et ta femme, tes fils et les femmes de tes fils avec toi.\\nFais sortir avec toi tous les animaux de toute chair qui sont avec toi, tant les oiseaux que le bétail et tous les reptiles qui rampent sur la terre: qu\\'ils se répandent sur la terre, qu\\'ils soient féconds et multiplient sur la terre.\\nEt Noé sortit, avec ses fils, sa femme, et les femmes de ses fils.\\nTous les animaux, tous les reptiles, tous les oiseaux, tout ce qui se meut sur la terre, selon leurs espèces, sortirent de l\\'arche.\\nNoé bâtit un autel à l\\'éternel; il prit de toutes les bêtes pures et de tous les oiseaux purs, et il offrit des holocaustes sur l\\'autel.\\nL\\'éternel sentit une odeur agréable, et l\\'éternel dit en son coeur: Je ne maudirai plus la terre, à cause de l\\'homme, parce que les pensées du coeur de l\\'homme sont mauvaises dès sa jeunesse; et je ne frapperai plus tout ce qui est vivant, comme je l\\'ai fait.\\nTant que la terre subsistera, les semailles et la moisson, le froid et la chaleur, l\\'été et l\\'hiver, le jour et la nuit ne cesseront point.\\nDieu bénit Noé et ses fils, et leur dit: Soyez féconds, multipliez, et remplissez la terre.\\nVous serez un sujet de crainte et d\\'effroi pour tout animal de la terre, pour tout oiseau du ciel, pour tout ce qui se meut sur la terre, et pour tous les poissons de la mer: ils sont livrés entre vos mains.\\nTout ce qui se meut et qui a vie vous servira de nourriture: je vous donne tout cela comme l\\'herbe verte.\\nSeulement, vous ne mangerez point de chair avec son âme, avec son sang.\\nSachez-le aussi, je redemanderai le sang de vos âmes, je le redemanderai à tout animal; et je redemanderai l\\'âme de l\\'homme à l\\'homme, à l\\'homme qui est son frère.\\nSi quelqu\\'un verse le sang de l\\'homme, par l\\'homme son sang sera versé; car Dieu a fait l\\'homme à son image.\\nEt vous, soyez féconds et multipliez, répandez-vous sur la terre et multipliez sur elle.\\nDieu parla encore à Noé et à ses fils avec lui, en disant:\\nVoici, j\\'établis mon alliance avec vous et avec votre postérité après vous;\\navec tous les êtres vivants qui sont avec vous, tant les oiseaux que le bétail et tous les animaux de la terre, soit avec tous ceux qui sont sortis de l\\'arche, soit avec tous les animaux de la terre.\\nJ\\'établis mon alliance avec vous: aucune chair ne sera plus exterminée par les eaux du déluge, et il n\\'y aura plus de déluge pour détruire la terre.\\nEt Dieu dit: C\\'est ici le signe de l\\'alliance que j\\'établis entre moi et vous, et tous les êtres vivants qui sont avec vous, pour les générations à toujours:\\nj\\'ai placé mon arc dans la nue, et il servira de signe d\\'alliance entre moi et la terre.\\nQuand j\\'aurai rassemblé des nuages au-dessus de la terre, l\\'arc paraîtra dans la nue;\\net je me souviendrai de mon alliance entre moi et vous, et tous les êtres vivants, de toute chair, et les eaux ne deviendront plus un déluge pour détruire toute chair.\\nL\\'arc sera dans la nue; et je le regarderai, pour me souvenir de l\\'alliance perpétuelle entre Dieu et tous les êtres vivants, de toute chair qui est sur la terre.\\nEt Dieu dit à Noé: Tel est le signe de l\\'alliance que j\\'établis entre moi et toute chair qui est sur la terre.\\nLes fils de Noé, qui sortirent de l\\'arche, étaient Sem, Cham et Japhet. Cham fut le père de Canaan.\\nCe sont là les trois fils de Noé, et c\\'est leur postérité qui peupla toute la terre.\\nNoé commença à cultiver la terre, et planta de la vigne.\\nIl but du vin, s\\'enivra, et se découvrit au milieu de sa tente.\\nCham, père de Canaan, vit la nudité de son père, et il le rapporta dehors à ses deux frères.\\nAlors Sem et Japhet prirent le manteau, le mirent sur leurs épaules, marchèrent à reculons, et couvrirent la nudité de leur père; comme leur visage était détourné, ils ne virent point la nudité de leur père.\\nLorsque Noé se réveilla de son vin, il apprit ce que lui avait fait son fils cadet.\\nEt il dit: Maudit soit Canaan! qu\\'il soit l\\'esclave des esclaves de ses frères!\\nIl dit encore: Béni soit l\\'éternel, Dieu de Sem, et que Canaan soit leur esclave!\\nQue Dieu étende les possessions de Japhet, qu\\'il habite dans les tentes de Sem, et que Canaan soit leur esclave!\\nNoé vécut, après le déluge, trois cent cinquante ans.\\nTous les jours de Noé furent de neuf cent cinquante ans; puis il mourut.\\nVoici la postérité des fils de Noé, Sem, Cham et Japhet. Il leur naquit des fils après le déluge.\\nLes fils de Japhet furent: Gomer, Magog, Madaï, Javan, Tubal, Méschec et Tiras.\\nLes fils de Gomer: Aschkenaz, Riphat et Togarma.\\nLes fils de Javan: élischa, Tarsis, Kittim et Dodanim.\\nC\\'est par eux qu\\'ont été peuplées les îles des nations selon leurs terres, selon la langue de chacun, selon leurs familles, selon leurs nations.\\nLes fils de Cham furent: Cusch, Mitsraïm, Puth et Canaan.\\nLes fils de Cusch: Saba, Havila, Sabta, Raema et Sabteca. Les fils de Raema: Séba et Dedan.\\nCusch engendra aussi Nimrod; c\\'est lui qui commença à être puissant sur la terre.\\nIl fut un vaillant chasseur devant l\\'éternel; c\\'est pourquoi l\\'on dit: Comme Nimrod, vaillant chasseur devant l\\'éternel.\\nIl régna d\\'abord sur Babel, érec, Accad et Calné, au pays de Schinear.\\nDe ce pays-là sortit Assur; il bâtit Ninive, Rehoboth Hir, Calach,\\net Résen entre Ninive et Calach; c\\'est la grande ville.\\nMitsraïm engendra les Ludim, les Anamim, les Lehabim, les Naphtuhim,\\nles Patrusim, les Casluhim, d\\'où sont sortis les Philistins, et les Caphtorim.\\nCanaan engendra Sidon, son premier-né, et Heth;\\net les Jébusiens, les Amoréens, les Guirgasiens,\\nles Héviens, les Arkiens, les Siniens,\\nles Arvadiens, les Tsemariens, les Hamathiens. Ensuite, les familles des Cananéens se dispersèrent.\\nLes limites des Cananéens allèrent depuis Sidon, du côté de Guérar, jusqu\\'à Gaza, et du côté de Sodome, de Gomorrhe, d\\'Adma et de Tseboïm, jusqu\\'à Léscha.\\nCe sont là les fils de Cham, selon leurs familles, selon leurs langues, selon leurs pays, selon leurs nations.\\nIl naquit aussi des fils à Sem, père de tous les fils d\\'Héber, et frère de Japhet l\\'aîné.\\nLes fils de Sem furent: élam, Assur, Arpacschad, Lud et Aram.\\nLes fils d\\'Aram: Uts, Hul, Guéter et Masch.\\nArpacschad engendra Schélach; et Schélach engendra Héber.\\nIl naquit à Héber deux fils: le nom de l\\'un était Péleg, parce que de son temps la terre fut partagée, et le nom de son frère était Jokthan.\\nJokthan engendra Almodad, Schéleph, Hatsarmaveth, Jérach,\\nHadoram, Uzal, Dikla,\\nObal, Abimaël, Séba,\\nOphir, Havila et Jobab. Tous ceux-là furent fils de Jokthan.\\nIls habitèrent depuis Méscha, du côté de Sephar, jusqu\\'à la montagne de l\\'orient.\\nCe sont là les fils de Sem, selon leurs familles, selon leurs langues, selon leurs pays, selon leurs nations.\\nTelles sont les familles des fils de Noé, selon leurs générations, selon leurs nations. Et c\\'est d\\'eux que sont sorties les nations qui se sont répandues sur la terre après le déluge.\\nToute la terre avait une seule langue et les mêmes mots.\\nComme ils étaient partis de l\\'orient, ils trouvèrent une plaine au pays de Schinear, et ils y habitèrent.\\nIls se dirent l\\'un à l\\'autre: Allons! faisons des briques, et cuisons-les au feu. Et la brique leur servit de pierre, et le bitume leur servit de ciment.\\nIls dirent encore: Allons! bâtissons-nous une ville et une tour dont le sommet touche au ciel, et faisons-nous un nom, afin que nous ne soyons pas dispersés sur la face de toute la terre.\\nL\\'éternel descendit pour voir la ville et la tour que bâtissaient les fils des hommes.\\nEt l\\'éternel dit: Voici, ils forment un seul peuple et ont tous une même langue, et c\\'est là ce qu\\'ils ont entrepris; maintenant rien ne les empêcherait de faire tout ce qu\\'ils auraient projeté.\\nAllons! descendons, et là confondons leur langage, afin qu\\'ils n\\'entendent plus la langue, les uns des autres.\\nEt l\\'éternel les dispersa loin de là sur la face de toute la terre; et ils cessèrent de bâtir la ville.\\nC\\'est pourquoi on l\\'appela du nom de Babel, car c\\'est là que l\\'éternel confondit le langage de toute la terre, et c\\'est de là que l\\'éternel les dispersa sur la face de toute la terre.\\nVoici la postérité de Sem. Sem, âgé de cent ans, engendra Arpacschad, deux ans après le déluge.\\nSem vécut, après la naissance d\\'Arpacschad, cinq cents ans; et il engendra des fils et des filles.\\nArpacschad, âgé de trente-cinq ans, engendra Schélach.\\nArpacschad vécut, après la naissance de Schélach, quatre cent trois ans; et il engendra des fils et des filles.\\nSchélach, âgé de trente ans, engendra Héber.\\nSchélach vécut, après la naissance d\\'Héber, quatre cent trois ans; et il engendra des fils et des filles.\\nHéber, âgé de trente-quatre ans, engendra Péleg.\\nHéber vécut, après la naissance de Péleg, quatre cent trente ans; et il engendra des fils et des filles.\\nPéleg, âgé de trente ans, engendra Rehu.\\nPéleg vécut, après la naissance de Rehu, deux cent neuf ans; et il engendra des fils et des filles.\\nRehu, âgé de trente-deux ans, engendra Serug.\\nRehu vécut, après la naissance de Serug, deux cent sept ans; et il engendra des fils et des filles.\\nSerug, âgé de trente ans, engendra Nachor.\\nSerug vécut, après la naissance de Nachor, deux cents ans; et il engendra des fils et des filles.\\nNachor, âgé de vingt-neuf ans, engendra Térach.\\nNachor vécut, après la naissance de Térach, cent dix-neuf ans; et il engendra des fils et des filles.\\nTérach, âgé de soixante-dix ans, engendra Abram, Nachor et Haran.\\nVoici la postérité de Térach. Térach engendra Abram, Nachor et Haran. -Haran engendra Lot.\\nEt Haran mourut en présence de Térach, son père, au pays de sa naissance, à Ur en Chaldée. -\\nAbram et Nachor prirent des femmes: le nom de la femme d\\'Abram était Saraï, et le nom de la femme de Nachor était Milca, fille d\\'Haran, père de Milca et père de Jisca.\\nSaraï était stérile: elle n\\'avait point d\\'enfants.\\nTérach prit Abram, son fils, et Lot, fils d\\'Haran, fils de son fils, et Saraï, sa belle-fille, femme d\\'Abram, son fils. Ils sortirent ensemble d\\'Ur en Chaldée, pour aller au pays de Canaan. Ils vinrent jusqu\\'à Charan, et ils y habitèrent.\\nLes jours de Térach furent de deux cent cinq ans; et Térach mourut à Charan.\\nL\\'éternel dit à Abram: Va-t-en de ton pays, de ta patrie, et de la maison de ton père, dans le pays que je te montrerai.\\nJe ferai de toi une grande nation, et je te bénirai; je rendrai ton nom grand, et tu seras une source de bénédiction.\\nJe bénirai ceux qui te béniront, et je maudirai ceux qui te maudiront; et toutes les familles de la terre seront bénies en toi.\\nAbram partit, comme l\\'éternel le lui avait dit, et Lot partit avec lui. Abram était âgé de soixante-quinze ans, lorsqu\\'il sortit de Charan.\\nAbram prit Saraï, sa femme, et Lot, fils de son frère, avec tous les biens qu\\'ils possédaient et les serviteurs qu\\'ils avaient acquis à Charan. Ils partirent pour aller dans le pays de Canaan, et ils arrivèrent au pays de Canaan.\\nAbram parcourut le pays jusqu\\'au lieu nommé Sichem, jusqu\\'aux chênes de Moré. Les Cananéens étaient alors dans le pays.\\nL\\'éternel apparut à Abram, et dit: Je donnerai ce pays à ta postérité. Et Abram bâtit là un autel à l\\'éternel, qui lui était apparu.\\nIl se transporta de là vers la montagne, à l\\'orient de Béthel, et il dressa ses tentes, ayant Béthel à l\\'occident et Aï à l\\'orient. Il bâtit encore là un autel à l\\'éternel, et il invoqua le nom de l\\'éternel.\\nAbram continua ses marches, en s\\'avançant vers le midi.\\nIl y eut une famine dans le pays; et Abram descendit en égypte pour y séjourner, car la famine était grande dans le pays.\\nComme il était près d\\'entrer en égypte, il dit à Saraï, sa femme: Voici, je sais que tu es une femme belle de figure.\\nQuand les égyptiens te verront, ils diront: C\\'est sa femme! Et ils me tueront, et te laisseront la vie.\\nDis, je te prie, que tu es ma soeur, afin que je sois bien traité à cause de toi, et que mon âme vive grâce à toi.\\nLorsque Abram fut arrivé en égypte, les égyptiens virent que la femme était fort belle.\\nLes grands de Pharaon la virent aussi et la vantèrent à Pharaon; et la femme fut emmenée dans la maison de Pharaon.\\nIl traita bien Abram à cause d\\'elle; et Abram reçut des brebis, des boeufs, des ânes, des serviteurs et des servantes, des ânesses, et des chameaux.\\nMais l\\'éternel frappa de grandes plaies Pharaon et sa maison, au sujet de Saraï, femme d\\'Abram.\\nAlors Pharaon appela Abram, et dit: Qu\\'est-ce que tu m\\'as fait? Pourquoi ne m\\'as-tu pas déclaré que c\\'est ta femme?\\nPourquoi as-tu dit: C\\'est ma soeur? Aussi l\\'ai-je prise pour ma femme. Maintenant, voici ta femme, prends-la, et va-t-en!\\nEt Pharaon donna ordre à ses gens de le renvoyer, lui et sa femme, avec tout ce qui lui appartenait.\\nAbram remonta d\\'égypte vers le midi, lui, sa femme, et tout ce qui lui appartenait, et Lot avec lui.\\nAbram était très riche en troupeaux, en argent et en or.\\nIl dirigea ses marches du midi jusqu\\'à Béthel, jusqu\\'au lieu où était sa tente au commencement, entre Béthel et Aï,\\nau lieu où était l\\'autel qu\\'il avait fait précédemment. Et là, Abram invoqua le nom de l\\'éternel.\\nLot, qui voyageait avec Abram, avait aussi des brebis, des boeufs et des tentes.\\nEt la contrée était insuffisante pour qu\\'ils demeurassent ensemble, car leurs biens étaient si considérables qu\\'ils ne pouvaient demeurer ensemble.\\nIl y eut querelle entre les bergers des troupeaux d\\'Abram et les bergers des troupeaux de Lot. Les Cananéens et les Phérésiens habitaient alors dans le pays.\\nAbram dit à Lot: Qu\\'il n\\'y ait point, je te prie, de dispute entre moi et toi, ni entre mes bergers et tes bergers; car nous sommes frères.\\nTout le pays n\\'est-il pas devant toi? Sépare-toi donc de moi: si tu vas à gauche, j\\'irai à droite; si tu vas à droite, j\\'irai à gauche.\\nLot leva les yeux, et vit toute la plaine du Jourdain, qui était entièrement arrosée. Avant que l\\'éternel eût détruit Sodome et Gomorrhe, c\\'était, jusqu\\'à Tsoar, comme un jardin de l\\'éternel, comme le pays d\\'égypte.\\nLot choisit pour lui toute la plaine du Jourdain, et il s\\'avança vers l\\'orient. C\\'est ainsi qu\\'ils se séparèrent l\\'un de l\\'autre.\\nAbram habita dans le pays de Canaan; et Lot habita dans les villes de la plaine, et dressa ses tentes jusqu\\'à Sodome.\\nLes gens de Sodome étaient méchants, et de grands pécheurs contre l\\'éternel.\\nL\\'éternel dit à Abram, après que Lot se fut séparé de lui: Lève les yeux, et, du lieu où tu es, regarde vers le nord et le midi, vers l\\'orient et l\\'occident;\\ncar tout le pays que tu vois, je le donnerai à toi et à ta postérité pour toujours.\\nJe rendrai ta postérité comme la poussière de la terre, en sorte que, si quelqu\\'un peut compter la poussière de la terre, ta postérité aussi sera comptée.\\nLève-toi, parcours le pays dans sa longueur et dans sa largeur; car je te le donnerai.\\nAbram leva ses tentes, et vint habiter parmi les chênes de Mamré, qui sont près d\\'Hébron. Et il bâtit là un autel à l\\'éternel.\\nDans le temps d\\'Amraphel, roi de Schinear, d\\'Arjoc, roi d\\'Ellasar, de Kedorlaomer, roi d\\'élam, et de Tideal, roi de Gojim,\\nil arriva qu\\'ils firent la guerre à Béra, roi de Sodome, à Birscha, roi de Gomorrhe, à Schineab, roi d\\'Adma, à Schémeéber, roi de Tseboïm, et au roi de Béla, qui est Tsoar.\\nCes derniers s\\'assemblèrent tous dans la vallée de Siddim, qui est la mer Salée.\\nPendant douze ans, ils avaient été soumis à Kedorlaomer; et la treizième année, ils s\\'étaient révoltés.\\nMais, la quatorzième année, Kedorlaomer et les rois qui étaient avec lui se mirent en marche, et ils battirent les Rephaïm à Aschteroth Karnaïm, les Zuzim à Ham, les émim à Schavé Kirjathaïm,\\net les Horiens dans leur montagne de Séir, jusqu\\'au chêne de Paran, qui est près du désert.\\nPuis ils s\\'en retournèrent, vinrent à En Mischpath, qui est Kadès, et battirent les Amalécites sur tout leur territoire, ainsi que les Amoréens établis à Hatsatson Thamar.\\nAlors s\\'avancèrent le roi de Sodome, le roi de Gomorrhe, le roi d\\'Adma, le roi de Tseboïm, et le roi de Béla, qui est Tsoar; et ils se rangèrent en bataille contre eux, dans la vallée de Siddim,\\ncontre Kedorlaomer, roi d\\'élam, Tideal, roi de Gojim, Amraphel, roi de Schinear, et Arjoc, roi d\\'Ellasar: quatre rois contre cinq.\\nLa vallée de Siddim était couverte de puits de bitume; le roi de Sodome et celui de Gomorrhe prirent la fuite, et y tombèrent; le reste s\\'enfuit vers la montagne.\\nLes vainqueurs enlevèrent toutes les richesses de Sodome et de Gomorrhe, et toutes leurs provisions; et ils s\\'en allèrent.\\nIls enlevèrent aussi, avec ses biens, Lot, fils du frère d\\'Abram, qui demeurait à Sodome; et ils s\\'en allèrent.\\nUn fuyard vint l\\'annoncer à Abram, l\\'Hébreu; celui-ci habitait parmi les chênes de Mamré, l\\'Amoréen, frère d\\'Eschcol et frère d\\'Aner, qui avaient fait alliance avec Abram.\\nDès qu\\'Abram eut appris que son frère avait été fait prisonnier, il arma trois cent dix-huit de ses plus braves serviteurs, nés dans sa maison, et il poursuivit les rois jusqu\\'à Dan.\\nIl divisa sa troupe, pour les attaquer de nuit, lui et ses serviteurs; il les battit, et les poursuivit jusqu\\'à Choba, qui est à la gauche de Damas.\\nIl ramena toutes les richesses; il ramena aussi Lot, son frère, avec ses biens, ainsi que les femmes et le peuple.\\nAprès qu\\'Abram fut revenu vainqueur de Kedorlaomer et des rois qui étaient avec lui, le roi de Sodome sortit à sa rencontre dans la vallée de Schavé, qui est la vallée du roi.\\nMelchisédek, roi de Salem, fit apporter du pain et du vin: il était sacrificateur du Dieu Très Haut.\\nIl bénit Abram, et dit: Béni soit Abram par le Dieu Très Haut, maître du ciel et de la terre!\\nBéni soit le Dieu Très Haut, qui a livré tes ennemis entre tes mains! Et Abram lui donna la dîme de tout.\\nLe roi de Sodome dit à Abram: Donne-moi les personnes, et prends pour toi les richesses.\\nAbram répondit au roi de Sodome: Je lève la main vers l\\'éternel, le Dieu Très Haut, maître du ciel et de la terre:\\nje ne prendrai rien de tout ce qui est à toi, pas même un fil, ni un cordon de soulier, afin que tu ne dises pas: J\\'ai enrichi Abram. Rien pour moi!\\nSeulement, ce qu\\'ont mangé les jeunes gens, et la part des hommes qui ont marché avec moi, Aner, Eschcol et Mamré: eux, ils prendront leur part.\\nAprès ces événements, la parole de l\\'éternel fut adressée à Abram dans une vision, et il dit: Abram, ne crains point; je suis ton bouclier, et ta récompense sera très grande.\\nAbram répondit: Seigneur éternel, que me donneras-tu? Je m\\'en vais sans enfants; et l\\'héritier de ma maison, c\\'est éliézer de Damas.\\nEt Abram dit: Voici, tu ne m\\'as pas donné de postérité, et celui qui est né dans ma maison sera mon héritier.\\nAlors la parole de l\\'éternel lui fut adressée ainsi: Ce n\\'est pas lui qui sera ton héritier, mais c\\'est celui qui sortira de tes entrailles qui sera ton héritier.\\nEt après l\\'avoir conduit dehors, il dit: Regarde vers le ciel, et compte les étoiles, si tu peux les compter. Et il lui dit: Telle sera ta postérité.\\nAbram eut confiance en l\\'éternel, qui le lui imputa à justice.\\nL\\'éternel lui dit encore: Je suis l\\'éternel, qui t\\'ai fait sortir d\\'Ur en Chaldée, pour te donner en possession ce pays.\\nAbram répondit: Seigneur éternel, à quoi connaîtrai-je que je le posséderai?\\nEt l\\'éternel lui dit: Prends une génisse de trois ans, une chèvre de trois ans, un bélier de trois ans, une tourterelle et une jeune colombe.\\nAbram prit tous ces animaux, les coupa par le milieu, et mit chaque morceau l\\'un vis-à-vis de l\\'autre; mais il ne partagea point les oiseaux.\\nLes oiseaux de proie s\\'abattirent sur les cadavres; et Abram les chassa.\\nAu coucher du soleil, un profond sommeil tomba sur Abram; et voici, une frayeur et une grande obscurité vinrent l\\'assaillir.\\nEt l\\'éternel dit à Abram: Sache que tes descendants seront étrangers dans un pays qui ne sera point à eux; ils y seront asservis, et on les opprimera pendant quatre cents ans.\\nMais je jugerai la nation à laquelle ils seront asservis, et ils sortiront ensuite avec de grandes richesses.\\nToi, tu iras en paix vers tes pères, tu seras enterré après une heureuse vieillesse.\\nA la quatrième génération, ils reviendront ici; car l\\'iniquité des Amoréens n\\'est pas encore à son comble.\\nQuand le soleil fut couché, il y eut une obscurité profonde; et voici, ce fut une fournaise fumante, et des flammes passèrent entre les animaux partagés.\\nEn ce jour-là, l\\'éternel fit alliance avec Abram, et dit: Je donne ce pays à ta postérité, depuis le fleuve d\\'égypte jusqu\\'au grand fleuve, au fleuve d\\'Euphrate,\\nle pays des Kéniens, des Keniziens, des Kadmoniens,\\ndes Héthiens, des Phéréziens, des Rephaïm,\\ndes Amoréens, des Cananéens, des Guirgasiens et des Jébusiens.\\nSaraï, femme d\\'Abram, ne lui avait point donné d\\'enfants. Elle avait une servante égyptienne, nommée Agar.\\nEt Saraï dit à Abram: Voici, l\\'éternel m\\'a rendue stérile; viens, je te prie, vers ma servante; peut-être aurai-je par elle des enfants. Abram écouta la voix de Saraï.\\nAlors Saraï, femme d\\'Abram, prit Agar, l\\'égyptienne, sa servante, et la donna pour femme à Abram, son mari, après qu\\'Abram eut habité dix années dans le pays de Canaan.\\nIl alla vers Agar, et elle devint enceinte. Quand elle se vit enceinte, elle regarda sa maîtresse avec mépris.\\nEt Saraï dit à Abram: L\\'outrage qui m\\'est fait retombe sur toi. J\\'ai mis ma servante dans ton sein; et, quand elle a vu qu\\'elle était enceinte, elle m\\'a regardée avec mépris. Que l\\'éternel soit juge entre moi et toi!\\nAbram répondit à Saraï: Voici, ta servante est en ton pouvoir, agis à son égard comme tu le trouveras bon. Alors Saraï la maltraita; et Agar s\\'enfuit loin d\\'elle.\\nL\\'ange de l\\'éternel la trouva près d\\'une source d\\'eau dans le désert, près de la source qui est sur le chemin de Schur.\\nIl dit: Agar, servante de Saraï, d\\'où viens-tu, et où vas-tu? Elle répondit: Je fuis loin de Saraï, ma maîtresse.\\nL\\'ange de l\\'éternel lui dit: Retourne vers ta maîtresse, et humilie-toi sous sa main.\\nL\\'ange de l\\'éternel lui dit: Je multiplierai ta postérité, et elle sera si nombreuse qu\\'on ne pourra la compter.\\nL\\'ange de l\\'éternel lui dit: Voici, tu es enceinte, et tu enfanteras un fils, à qui tu donneras le nom d\\'Ismaël; car l\\'éternel t\\'a entendue dans ton affliction.\\nIl sera comme un âne sauvage; sa main sera contre tous, et la main de tous sera contre lui; et il habitera en face de tous ses frères.\\nElle appela Atta El roï le nom de l\\'éternel qui lui avait parlé; car elle dit: Ai-je rien vu ici, après qu\\'il m\\'a vue?\\nC\\'est pourquoi l\\'on a appelé ce puits le puits de Lachaï roï; il est entre Kadès et Bared.\\nAgar enfanta un fils à Abram; et Abram donna le nom d\\'Ismaël au fils qu\\'Agar lui enfanta.\\nAbram était âgé de quatre-vingt-six ans lorsqu\\'Agar enfanta Ismaël à Abram.\\nLorsque Abram fut âgé de quatre-vingt-dix-neuf ans, l\\'éternel apparut à Abram, et lui dit: Je suis le Dieu tout puissant. Marche devant ma face, et sois intègre.\\nJ\\'établirai mon alliance entre moi et toi, et je te multiplierai à l\\'infini.\\nAbram tomba sur sa face; et Dieu lui parla, en disant:\\nVoici mon alliance, que je fais avec toi. Tu deviendras père d\\'une multitude de nations.\\nOn ne t\\'appellera plus Abram; mais ton nom sera Abraham, car je te rends père d\\'une multitude de nations.\\nJe te rendrai fécond à l\\'infini, je ferai de toi des nations; et des rois sortiront de toi.\\nJ\\'établirai mon alliance entre moi et toi, et tes descendants après toi, selon leurs générations: ce sera une alliance perpétuelle, en vertu de laquelle je serai ton Dieu et celui de ta postérité après toi.\\nJe te donnerai, et à tes descendants après toi, le pays que tu habites comme étranger, tout le pays de Canaan, en possession perpétuelle, et je serai leur Dieu.\\nDieu dit à Abraham: Toi, tu garderas mon alliance, toi et tes descendants après toi, selon leurs générations.\\nC\\'est ici mon alliance, que vous garderez entre moi et vous, et ta postérité après toi: tout mâle parmi vous sera circoncis.\\nVous vous circoncirez; et ce sera un signe d\\'alliance entre moi et vous.\\nA l\\'âge de huit jours, tout mâle parmi vous sera circoncis, selon vos générations, qu\\'il soit né dans la maison, ou qu\\'il soit acquis à prix d\\'argent de tout fils d\\'étranger, sans appartenir à ta race.\\nOn devra circoncire celui qui est né dans la maison et celui qui est acquis à prix d\\'argent; et mon alliance sera dans votre chair une alliance perpétuelle.\\nUn mâle incirconcis, qui n\\'aura pas été circoncis dans sa chair, sera exterminé du milieu de son peuple: il aura violé mon alliance.\\nDieu dit à Abraham: Tu ne donneras plus à Saraï, ta femme, le nom de Saraï; mais son nom sera Sara.\\nJe la bénirai, et je te donnerai d\\'elle un fils; je la bénirai, et elle deviendra des nations; des rois de peuples sortiront d\\'elle.\\nAbraham tomba sur sa face; il rit, et dit en son coeur: Naîtrait-il un fils à un homme de cent ans? et Sara, âgée de quatre-vingt-dix ans, enfanterait-elle?\\nEt Abraham dit à Dieu: Oh! qu\\'Ismaël vive devant ta face!\\nDieu dit: Certainement Sara, ta femme, t\\'enfantera un fils; et tu l\\'appelleras du nom d\\'Isaac. J\\'établirai mon alliance avec lui comme une alliance perpétuelle pour sa postérité après lui.\\nA l\\'égard d\\'Ismaël, je t\\'ai exaucé. Voici, je le bénirai, je le rendrai fécond, et je le multiplierai à l\\'infini; il engendrera douze princes, et je ferai de lui une grande nation.\\nJ\\'établirai mon alliance avec Isaac, que Sara t\\'enfantera à cette époque-ci de l\\'année prochaine.\\nLorsqu\\'il eut achevé de lui parler, Dieu s\\'éleva au-dessus d\\'Abraham.\\nAbraham prit Ismaël, son fils, tous ceux qui étaient nés dans sa maison et tous ceux qu\\'il avait acquis à prix d\\'argent, tous les mâles parmi les gens de la maison d\\'Abraham; et il les circoncit ce même jour, selon l\\'ordre que Dieu lui avait donné.\\nAbraham était âgé de quatre-vingt-dix-neuf ans, lorsqu\\'il fut circoncis.\\nIsmaël, son fils, était âgé de treize ans lorsqu\\'il fut circoncis.\\nCe même jour, Abraham fut circoncis, ainsi qu\\'Ismaël, son fils.\\nEt tous les gens de sa maison, nés dans sa maison, ou acquis à prix d\\'argent des étrangers, furent circoncis avec lui.\\nL\\'éternel lui apparut parmi les chênes de Mamré, comme il était assis à l\\'entrée de sa tente, pendant la chaleur du jour.\\nIl leva les yeux, et regarda: et voici, trois hommes étaient debout près de lui. Quand il les vit, il courut au-devant d\\'eux, depuis l\\'entrée de sa tente, et se prosterna en terre.\\nEt il dit: Seigneur, si j\\'ai trouvé grâce à tes yeux, ne passe point, je te prie, loin de ton serviteur.\\nPermettez qu\\'on apporte un peu d\\'eau, pour vous laver les pieds; et reposez-vous sous cet arbre.\\nJ\\'irai prendre un morceau de pain, pour fortifier votre coeur; après quoi, vous continuerez votre route; car c\\'est pour cela que vous passez près de votre serviteur. Ils répondirent: Fais comme tu l\\'as dit.\\nAbraham alla promptement dans sa tente vers Sara, et il dit: Vite, trois mesures de fleur de farine, pétris, et fais des gâteaux.\\nEt Abraham courut à son troupeau, prit un veau tendre et bon, et le donna à un serviteur, qui se hâta de l\\'apprêter.\\nIl prit encore de la crème et du lait, avec le veau qu\\'on avait apprêté, et il les mit devant eux. Il se tint lui-même à leurs côtés, sous l\\'arbre. Et ils mangèrent.\\nAlors ils lui dirent: Où est Sara, ta femme? Il répondit: Elle est là, dans la tente.\\nL\\'un d\\'entre eux dit: Je reviendrai vers toi à cette même époque; et voici, Sara, ta femme, aura un fils. Sara écoutait à l\\'entrée de la tente, qui était derrière lui.\\nAbraham et Sara étaient vieux, avancés en âge: et Sara ne pouvait plus espérer avoir des enfants.\\nElle rit en elle-même, en disant: Maintenant que je suis vieille, aurais-je encore des désirs? Mon seigneur aussi est vieux.\\nL\\'éternel dit à Abraham: Pourquoi donc Sara a-t-elle ri, en disant: Est-ce que vraiment j\\'aurais un enfant, moi qui suis vieille?\\nY a-t-il rien qui soit étonnant de la part de l\\'éternel? Au temps fixé je reviendrai vers toi, à cette même époque; et Sara aura un fils.\\nSara mentit, en disant: Je n\\'ai pas ri. Car elle eut peur. Mais il dit: Au contraire, tu as ri.\\nCes hommes se levèrent pour partir, et ils regardèrent du côté de Sodome. Abraham alla avec eux, pour les accompagner.\\nAlors l\\'éternel dit: Cacherai-je à Abraham ce que je vais faire?...\\nAbraham deviendra certainement une nation grande et puissante, et en lui seront bénies toutes les nations de la terre.\\nCar je l\\'ai choisi, afin qu\\'il ordonne à ses fils et à sa maison après lui de garder la voie de l\\'éternel, en pratiquant la droiture et la justice, et qu\\'ainsi l\\'éternel accomplisse en faveur d\\'Abraham les promesses qu\\'il lui a faites...\\nEt l\\'éternel dit: Le cri contre Sodome et Gomorrhe s\\'est accru, et leur péché est énorme.\\nC\\'est pourquoi je vais descendre, et je verrai s\\'ils ont agi entièrement selon le bruit venu jusqu\\'à moi; et si cela n\\'est pas, je le saurai.\\nLes hommes s\\'éloignèrent, et allèrent vers Sodome. Mais Abraham se tint encore en présence de l\\'éternel.\\nAbraham s\\'approcha, et dit: Feras-tu aussi périr le juste avec le méchant?\\nPeut-être y a-t-il cinquante justes au milieu de la ville: les feras-tu périr aussi, et ne pardonneras-tu pas à la ville à cause des cinquante justes qui sont au milieu d\\'elle?\\nFaire mourir le juste avec le méchant, en sorte qu\\'il en soit du juste comme du méchant, loin de toi cette manière d\\'agir! loin de toi! Celui qui juge toute la terre n\\'exercera-t-il pas la justice?\\nEt l\\'éternel dit: Si je trouve dans Sodome cinquante justes au milieu de la ville, je pardonnerai à toute la ville, à cause d\\'eux.\\nAbraham reprit, et dit: Voici, j\\'ai osé parler au Seigneur, moi qui ne suis que poudre et cendre.\\nPeut-être des cinquante justes en manquera-t-il cinq: pour cinq, détruiras-tu toute la ville? Et l\\'éternel dit: Je ne la détruirai point, si j\\'y trouve quarante-cinq justes.\\nAbraham continua de lui parler, et dit: Peut-être s\\'y trouvera-t-il quarante justes. Et l\\'éternel dit: Je ne ferai rien, à cause de ces quarante.\\nAbraham dit: Que le Seigneur ne s\\'irrite point, et je parlerai. Peut-être s\\'y trouvera-t-il trente justes. Et l\\'éternel dit: Je ne ferai rien, si j\\'y trouve trente justes.\\nAbraham dit: Voici, j\\'ai osé parler au Seigneur. Peut-être s\\'y trouvera-t-il vingt justes. Et l\\'éternel dit: Je ne la détruirai point, à cause de ces vingt.\\nAbraham dit: Que le Seigneur ne s\\'irrite point, et je ne parlerai plus que cette fois. Peut-être s\\'y trouvera-t-il dix justes. Et l\\'éternel dit: Je ne la détruirai point, à cause de ces dix justes.\\nL\\'éternel s\\'en alla lorsqu\\'il eut achevé de parler à Abraham. Et Abraham retourna dans sa demeure.\\nLes deux anges arrivèrent à Sodome sur le soir; et Lot était assis à la porte de Sodome. Quand Lot les vit, il se leva pour aller au-devant d\\'eux, et se prosterna la face contre terre.\\nPuis il dit: Voici, mes seigneurs, entrez, je vous prie, dans la maison de votre serviteur, et passez-y la nuit; lavez-vous les pieds; vous vous lèverez de bon matin, et vous poursuivrez votre route. Non, répondirent-ils, nous passerons la nuit dans la rue.\\nMais Lot les pressa tellement qu\\'ils vinrent chez lui et entrèrent dans sa maison. Il leur donna un festin, et fit cuire des pains sans levain. Et ils mangèrent.\\nIls n\\'étaient pas encore couchés que les gens de la ville, les gens de Sodome, entourèrent la maison, depuis les enfants jusqu\\'aux vieillards; toute la population était accourue.\\nIls appelèrent Lot, et lui dirent: Où sont les hommes qui sont entrés chez toi cette nuit? Fais-les sortir vers nous, pour que nous les connaissions.\\nLot sortit vers eux à l\\'entrée de la maison, et ferma la porte derrière lui.\\nEt il dit: Mes frères, je vous prie, ne faites pas le mal!\\nVoici, j\\'ai deux filles qui n\\'ont point connu d\\'homme; je vous les amènerai dehors, et vous leur ferez ce qu\\'il vous plaira. Seulement, ne faites rien à ces hommes puisqu\\'ils sont venus à l\\'ombre de mon toit.\\nIls dirent: Retire-toi! Ils dirent encore: Celui-ci est venu comme étranger, et il veut faire le juge! Eh bien, nous te ferons pis qu\\'à eux. Et, pressant Lot avec violence, ils s\\'avancèrent pour briser la porte.\\nLes hommes étendirent la main, firent rentrer Lot vers eux dans la maison, et fermèrent la porte.\\nEt ils frappèrent d\\'aveuglement les gens qui étaient à l\\'entrée de la maison, depuis le plus petit jusqu\\'au plus grand, de sorte qu\\'ils se donnèrent une peine inutile pour trouver la porte.\\nLes hommes dirent à Lot: Qui as-tu encore ici? Gendres, fils et filles, et tout ce qui t\\'appartient dans la ville, fais-les sortir de ce lieu.\\nCar nous allons détruire ce lieu, parce que le cri contre ses habitants est grand devant l\\'éternel. L\\'éternel nous a envoyés pour le détruire.\\nLot sortit, et parla à ses gendres qui avaient pris ses filles: Levez-vous, dit-il, sortez de ce lieu; car l\\'éternel va détruire la ville. Mais, aux yeux de ses gendres, il parut plaisanter.\\nDès l\\'aube du jour, les anges insistèrent auprès de Lot, en disant: Lève-toi, prends ta femme et tes deux filles qui se trouvent ici, de peur que tu ne périsses dans la ruine de la ville.\\nEt comme il tardait, les hommes le saisirent par la main, lui, sa femme et ses deux filles, car l\\'éternel voulait l\\'épargner; ils l\\'emmenèrent, et le laissèrent hors de la ville.\\nAprès les avoir fait sortir, l\\'un d\\'eux dit: Sauve-toi, pour ta vie; ne regarde pas derrière toi, et ne t\\'arrête pas dans toute la plaine; sauve-toi vers la montagne, de peur que tu ne périsses.\\nLot leur dit: Oh! non, Seigneur!\\nVoici, j\\'ai trouvé grâce à tes yeux, et tu as montré la grandeur de ta miséricorde à mon égard, en me conservant la vie; mais je ne puis me sauver à la montagne, avant que le désastre m\\'atteigne, et je périrai.\\nVoici, cette ville est assez proche pour que je m\\'y réfugie, et elle est petite. Oh! que je puisse m\\'y sauver,... n\\'est-elle pas petite?... et que mon âme vive!\\nEt il lui dit: Voici, je t\\'accorde encore cette grâce, et je ne détruirai pas la ville dont tu parles.\\nHâte-toi de t\\'y réfugier, car je ne puis rien faire jusqu\\'à ce que tu y sois arrivé. C\\'est pour cela que l\\'on a donné à cette ville le nom de Tsoar.\\nLe soleil se levait sur la terre, lorsque Lot entra dans Tsoar.\\nAlors l\\'éternel fit pleuvoir du ciel sur Sodome et sur Gomorrhe du soufre et du feu, de par l\\'éternel.\\nIl détruisit ces villes, toute la plaine et tous les habitants des villes, et les plantes de la terre.\\nLa femme de Lot regarda en arrière, et elle devint une statue de sel.\\nAbraham se leva de bon matin, pour aller au lieu où il s\\'était tenu en présence de l\\'éternel.\\nIl porta ses regards du côté de Sodome et de Gomorrhe, et sur tout le territoire de la plaine; et voici, il vit s\\'élever de la terre une fumée, comme la fumée d\\'une fournaise.\\nLorsque Dieu détruisit les villes de la plaine, il se souvint d\\'Abraham; et il fit échapper Lot du milieu du désastre, par lequel il bouleversa les villes où Lot avait établi sa demeure.\\nLot quitta Tsoar pour la hauteur, et se fixa sur la montagne, avec ses deux filles, car il craignait de rester à Tsoar. Il habita dans une caverne, lui et ses deux filles.\\nL\\'aînée dit à la plus jeune: Notre père est vieux; et il n\\'y a point d\\'homme dans la contrée, pour venir vers nous, selon l\\'usage de tous les pays.\\nViens, faisons boire du vin à notre père, et couchons avec lui, afin que nous conservions la race de notre père.\\nElles firent donc boire du vin à leur père cette nuit-là; et l\\'aînée alla coucher avec son père: il ne s\\'aperçut ni quand elle se coucha, ni quand elle se leva.\\nLe lendemain, l\\'aînée dit à la plus jeune: Voici, j\\'ai couché la nuit dernière avec mon père; faisons-lui boire du vin encore cette nuit, et va coucher avec lui, afin que nous conservions la race de notre père.\\nElles firent boire du vin à leur père encore cette nuit-là; et la cadette alla coucher avec lui: il ne s\\'aperçut ni quand elle se coucha, ni quand elle se leva.\\nLes deux filles de Lot devinrent enceintes de leur père.\\nL\\'aînée enfanta un fils, qu\\'elle appela du nom de Moab: c\\'est le père des Moabites, jusqu\\'à ce jour.\\nLa plus jeune enfanta aussi un fils, qu\\'elle appela du nom de Ben Ammi: c\\'est le père des Ammonites, jusqu\\'à ce jour.\\nAbraham partit de là pour la contrée du midi; il s\\'établit entre Kadès et Schur, et fit un séjour à Guérar.\\nAbraham disait de Sara, sa femme: C\\'est ma soeur. Abimélec, roi de Guérar, fit enlever Sara.\\nAlors Dieu apparut en songe à Abimélec pendant la nuit, et lui dit: Voici, tu vas mourir à cause de la femme que tu as enlevée, car elle a un mari.\\nAbimélec, qui ne s\\'était point approché d\\'elle, répondit: Seigneur, ferais-tu périr même une nation juste?\\nNe m\\'a-t-il pas dit: C\\'est ma soeur? et elle-même n\\'a-t-elle pas dit: C\\'est mon frère? J\\'ai agi avec un coeur pur et avec des mains innocentes.\\nDieu lui dit en songe: Je sais que tu as agi avec un coeur pur; aussi t\\'ai-je empêché de pécher contre moi. C\\'est pourquoi je n\\'ai pas permis que tu la touchasse.\\nMaintenant, rends la femme de cet homme; car il est prophète, il priera pour toi, et tu vivras. Mais, si tu ne la rends pas, sache que tu mourras, toi et tout ce qui t\\'appartient.\\nAbimélec se leva de bon matin, il appela tous ses serviteurs, et leur rapporta toutes ces choses; et ces gens furent saisis d\\'une grande frayeur.\\nAbimélec appela aussi Abraham, et lui dit: Qu\\'est-ce que tu nous as fait? Et en quoi t\\'ai-je offensé, que tu aies fait venir sur moi et sur mon royaume un si grand péché? Tu as commis à mon égard des actes qui ne doivent pas se commettre.\\nEt Abimélec dit à Abraham: Quelle intention avais-tu pour agir de la sorte?\\nAbraham répondit: Je me disais qu\\'il n\\'y avait sans doute aucune crainte de Dieu dans ce pays, et que l\\'on me tuerait à cause de ma femme.\\nDe plus, il est vrai qu\\'elle est ma soeur, fille de mon père; seulement, elle n\\'est pas fille de ma mère; et elle est devenue ma femme.\\nLorsque Dieu me fit errer loin de la maison de mon père, je dis à Sara: Voici la grâce que tu me feras; dans tous les lieux où nous irons, dis de moi: C\\'est mon frère.\\nAbimélec prit des brebis et des boeufs, des serviteurs et des servantes, et les donna à Abraham; et il lui rendit Sara, sa femme.\\nAbimélec dit: Voici, mon pays est devant toi; demeure où il te plaira.\\nEt il dit à Sara: Voici, je donne à ton frère mille pièces d\\'argent; cela te sera un voile sur les yeux pour tous ceux qui sont avec toi, et auprès de tous tu seras justifiée.\\nAbraham pria Dieu, et Dieu guérit Abimélec, sa femme et ses servantes; et elles purent enfanter.\\nCar l\\'éternel avait frappé de stérilité toute la maison d\\'Abimélec, à cause de Sara, femme d\\'Abraham.\\nL\\'éternel se souvint de ce qu\\'il avait dit à Sara, et l\\'éternel accomplit pour Sara ce qu\\'il avait promis.\\nSara devint enceinte, et elle enfanta un fils à Abraham dans sa vieillesse, au temps fixé dont Dieu lui avait parlé.\\nAbraham donna le nom d\\'Isaac au fils qui lui était né, que Sara lui avait enfanté.\\nAbraham circoncit son fils Isaac, âgé de huit jours, comme Dieu le lui avait ordonné.\\nAbraham était âgé de cent ans, à la naissance d\\'Isaac, son fils.\\nEt Sara dit: Dieu m\\'a fait un sujet de rire; quiconque l\\'apprendra rira de moi.\\nElle ajouta: Qui aurait dit à Abraham: Sara allaitera des enfants? Cependant je lui ai enfanté un fils dans sa vieillesse.\\nL\\'enfant grandit, et fut sevré; et Abraham fit un grand festin le jour où Isaac fut sevré.\\nSara vit rire le fils qu\\'Agar, l\\'égyptienne, avait enfanté à Abraham;\\net elle dit à Abraham: Chasse cette servante et son fils, car le fils de cette servante n\\'héritera pas avec mon fils, avec Isaac.\\nCette parole déplut fort aux yeux d\\'Abraham, à cause de son fils.\\nMais Dieu dit à Abraham: Que cela ne déplaise pas à tes yeux, à cause de l\\'enfant et de ta servante. Accorde à Sara tout ce qu\\'elle te demandera; car c\\'est d\\'Isaac que sortira une postérité qui te sera propre.\\nJe ferai aussi une nation du fils de ta servante; car il est ta postérité.\\nAbraham se leva de bon matin; il prit du pain et une outre d\\'eau, qu\\'il donna à Agar et plaça sur son épaule; il lui remit aussi l\\'enfant, et la renvoya. Elle s\\'en alla, et s\\'égara dans le désert de Beer Schéba.\\nQuand l\\'eau de l\\'outre fut épuisée, elle laissa l\\'enfant sous un des arbrisseaux,\\net alla s\\'asseoir vis-à-vis, à une portée d\\'arc; car elle disait: Que je ne voie pas mourir mon enfant! Elle s\\'assit donc vis-à-vis de lui, éleva la voix et pleura.\\nDieu entendit la voix de l\\'enfant; et l\\'ange de Dieu appela du ciel Agar, et lui dit: Qu\\'as-tu, Agar? Ne crains point, car Dieu a entendu la voix de l\\'enfant dans le lieu où il est.\\nLève-toi, prends l\\'enfant, saisis-le de ta main; car je ferai de lui une grande nation.\\nEt Dieu lui ouvrit les yeux, et elle vit un puits d\\'eau; elle alla remplir d\\'eau l\\'outre, et donna à boire à l\\'enfant.\\nDieu fut avec l\\'enfant, qui grandit, habita dans le désert, et devint tireur d\\'arc.\\nIl habita dans le désert de Paran, et sa mère lui prit une femme du pays d\\'égypte.\\nEn ce temps-là, Abimélec, accompagné de Picol, chef de son armée, parla ainsi à Abraham: Dieu est avec toi dans tout ce que tu fais.\\nJure-moi maintenant ici, par le nom de Dieu, que tu ne tromperas ni moi, ni mes enfants, ni mes petits-enfants, et que tu auras pour moi et le pays où tu séjournes la même bienveillance que j\\'ai eue pour toi.\\nAbraham dit: Je le jurerai.\\nMais Abraham fit des reproches à Abimélec, au sujet d\\'un puits d\\'eau, dont s\\'étaient emparés de force les serviteurs d\\'Abimélec.\\nAbimélec répondit: J\\'ignore qui a fait cette chose-là; tu ne m\\'en as point informé, et moi, je ne l\\'apprends qu\\'aujourd\\'hui.\\nEt Abraham prit des brebis et des boeufs, qu\\'il donna à Abimélec; et ils firent tous deux alliance.\\nAbraham mit à part sept jeunes brebis.\\nEt Abimélec dit à Abraham: Qu\\'est-ce que ces sept jeunes brebis, que tu as mises à part?\\nIl répondit: Tu accepteras de ma main ces sept brebis, afin que cela me serve de témoignage que j\\'ai creusé ce puits.\\nC\\'est pourquoi on appelle ce lieu Beer Schéba; car c\\'est là qu\\'ils jurèrent l\\'un et l\\'autre.\\nIls firent donc alliance à Beer Schéba. Après quoi, Abimélec se leva, avec Picol, chef de son armée; et ils retournèrent au pays des Philistins.\\nAbraham planta des tamariscs à Beer Schéba; et là il invoqua le nom de l\\'éternel, Dieu de l\\'éternité.\\nAbraham séjourna longtemps dans le pays des Philistins.\\nAprès ces choses, Dieu mit Abraham à l\\'épreuve, et lui dit: Abraham! Et il répondit: Me voici!\\nDieu dit: Prends ton fils, ton unique, celui que tu aimes, Isaac; va-t\\'en au pays de Morija, et là offre-le en holocauste sur l\\'une des montagnes que je te dirai.\\nAbraham se leva de bon matin, sella son âne, et prit avec lui deux serviteurs et son fils Isaac. Il fendit du bois pour l\\'holocauste, et partit pour aller au lieu que Dieu lui avait dit.\\nLe troisième jour, Abraham, levant les yeux, vit le lieu de loin.\\nEt Abraham dit à ses serviteurs: Restez ici avec l\\'âne; moi et le jeune homme, nous irons jusque-là pour adorer, et nous reviendrons auprès de vous.\\nAbraham prit le bois pour l\\'holocauste, le chargea sur son fils Isaac, et porta dans sa main le feu et le couteau. Et il marchèrent tous deux ensemble.\\nAlors Isaac, parlant à Abraham, son père, dit: Mon père! Et il répondit: Me voici, mon fils! Isaac reprit: Voici le feu et le bois; mais où est l\\'agneau pour l\\'holocauste?\\nAbraham répondit: Mon fils, Dieu se pourvoira lui-même de l\\'agneau pour l\\'holocauste. Et ils marchèrent tous deux ensemble.\\nLorsqu\\'ils furent arrivés au lieu que Dieu lui avait dit, Abraham y éleva un autel, et rangea le bois. Il lia son fils Isaac, et le mit sur l\\'autel, par-dessus le bois.\\nPuis Abraham étendit la main, et prit le couteau, pour égorger son fils.\\nAlors l\\'ange de l\\'éternel l\\'appela des cieux, et dit: Abraham! Abraham! Et il répondit: Me voici!\\nL\\'ange dit: N\\'avance pas ta main sur l\\'enfant, et ne lui fais rien; car je sais maintenant que tu crains Dieu, et que tu ne m\\'as pas refusé ton fils, ton unique.\\nAbraham leva les yeux, et vit derrière lui un bélier retenu dans un buisson par les cornes; et Abraham alla prendre le bélier, et l\\'offrit en holocauste à la place de son fils.\\nAbraham donna à ce lieu le nom de Jehova Jiré. C\\'est pourquoi l\\'on dit aujourd\\'hui: A la montagne de l\\'éternel il sera pourvu.\\nL\\'ange de l\\'éternel appela une seconde fois Abraham des cieux,\\net dit: Je le jure par moi-même, parole de l\\'éternel! parce que tu as fais cela, et que tu n\\'as pas refusé ton fils, ton unique,\\nje te bénirai et je multiplierai ta postérité, comme les étoiles du ciel et comme le sable qui est sur le bord de la mer; et ta postérité possédera la porte de ses ennemis.\\nToutes les nations de la terre seront bénies en ta postérité, parce que tu as obéi à ma voix.\\nAbraham étant retourné vers ses serviteurs, ils se levèrent et s\\'en allèrent ensemble à Beer Schéba; car Abraham demeurait à Beer Schéba.\\nAprès ces choses, on fit à Abraham un rapport, en disant: Voici, Milca a aussi enfanté des fils à Nachor, ton frère:\\nUts, son premier-né, Buz, son frère, Kemuel, père d\\'Aram,\\nKésed, Hazo, Pildasch, Jidlaph et Bethuel.\\nBethuel a engendré Rebecca. Ce sont là les huit fils que Milca a enfantés à Nachor, frère d\\'Abraham.\\nSa concubine, nommée Réuma, a aussi enfanté Thébach, Gaham, Tahasch et Maaca.\\nLa vie de Sara fut de cent vingt-sept ans: telles sont les années de la vie de Sara.\\nSara mourut à Kirjath Arba, qui est Hébron, dans le pays de Canaan; et Abraham vint pour mener deuil sur Sara et pour la pleurer.\\nAbraham se leva de devant son mort, et parla ainsi aux fils de Heth:\\nJe suis étranger et habitant parmi vous; donnez-moi la possession d\\'un sépulcre chez vous, pour enterrer mon mort et l\\'ôter de devant moi.\\nLes fils de Heth répondirent à Abraham, en lui disant:\\nécoute-nous, mon seigneur! Tu es un prince de Dieu au milieu de nous; enterre ton mort dans celui de nos sépulcres que tu choisiras; aucun de nous ne te refusera son sépulcre pour enterrer ton mort.\\nAbraham se leva, et se prosterna devant le peuple du pays, devant les fils de Heth.\\nEt il leur parla ainsi: Si vous permettez que j\\'enterre mon mort et que je l\\'ôte de devant mes yeux, écoutez-moi, et priez pour moi éphron, fils de Tsochar,\\nde me céder la caverne de Macpéla, qui lui appartient, à l\\'extrémité de son champ, de me la céder contre sa valeur en argent, afin qu\\'elle me serve de possession sépulcrale au milieu de vous.\\néphron était assis parmi les fils de Heth. Et éphron, le Héthien, répondit à Abraham, en présence des fils de Heth et de tous ceux qui entraient par la porte de sa ville:\\nNon, mon seigneur, écoute-moi! Je te donne le champ, et je te donne la caverne qui y est. Je te les donne, aux yeux des fils de mon peuple: enterre ton mort.\\nAbraham se prosterna devant le peuple du pays.\\nEt il parla ainsi à éphron, en présence du peuple du pays: écoute-moi, je te prie! Je donne le prix du champ: accepte-le de moi; et j\\'y enterrerai mon mort.\\nEt éphron répondit à Abraham, en lui disant:\\nMon seigneur, écoute-moi! Une terre de quatre cents sicles d\\'argent, qu\\'est-ce que cela entre moi et toi? Enterre ton mort.\\nAbraham comprit éphron; et Abraham pesa à éphron l\\'argent qu\\'il avait dit, en présence des fils de Heth, quatre cents sicles d\\'argent ayant cours chez le marchand.\\nLe champ d\\'éphron à Macpéla, vis-à-vis de Mamré, le champ et la caverne qui y est, et tous les arbres qui sont dans le champ et dans toutes ses limites alentour,\\ndevinrent ainsi la propriété d\\'Abraham, aux yeux des fils de Heth et de tous ceux qui entraient par la porte de sa ville.\\nAprès cela, Abraham enterra Sara, sa femme, dans la caverne du champ de Macpéla, vis-à-vis de Mamré, qui est Hébron, dans le pays de Canaan.\\nLe champ et la caverne qui y est demeurèrent à Abraham comme possession sépulcrale, acquise des fils de Heth.\\nAbraham était vieux, avancé en âge; et l\\'éternel avait béni Abraham en toute chose.\\nAbraham dit à son serviteur, le plus ancien de sa maison, l\\'intendant de tous ses biens: Mets, je te prie, ta main sous ma cuisse;\\net je te ferai jurer par l\\'éternel, le Dieu du ciel et le Dieu de la terre, de ne pas prendre pour mon fils une femme parmi les filles des Cananéens au milieu desquels j\\'habite,\\nmais d\\'aller dans mon pays et dans ma patrie prendre une femme pour mon fils Isaac.\\nLe serviteur lui répondit: Peut-être la femme ne voudra-t-elle pas me suivre dans ce pays-ci; devrai-je mener ton fils dans le pays d\\'où tu es sorti?\\nAbraham lui dit: Garde-toi d\\'y mener mon fils!\\nL\\'éternel, le Dieu du ciel, qui m\\'a fait sortir de la maison de mon père et de ma patrie, qui m\\'a parlé et qui m\\'a juré, en disant: Je donnerai ce pays à ta postérité, lui-même enverra son ange devant toi; et c\\'est de là que tu prendras une femme pour mon fils.\\nSi la femme ne veut pas te suivre, tu seras dégagé de ce serment que je te fais faire. Seulement, tu n\\'y mèneras pas mon fils.\\nLe serviteur mit sa main sous la cuisse d\\'Abraham, son seigneur, et lui jura d\\'observer ces choses.\\nLe serviteur prit dix chameaux parmi les chameaux de son seigneur, et il partit, ayant à sa disposition tous les biens de son seigneur. Il se leva, et alla en Mésopotamie, à la ville de Nachor.\\nIl fit reposer les chameaux sur leurs genoux hors de la ville, près d\\'un puits, au temps du soir, au temps où sortent celles qui vont puiser de l\\'eau.\\nEt il dit: éternel, Dieu de mon seigneur Abraham, fais-moi, je te prie, rencontrer aujourd\\'hui ce que je désire, et use de bonté envers mon seigneur Abraham!\\nVoici, je me tiens près de la source d\\'eau, et les filles des gens de la ville vont sortir pour puiser l\\'eau.\\nQue la jeune fille à laquelle je dirai: Penche ta cruche, je te prie, pour que je boive, et qui répondra: Bois, et je donnerai aussi à boire à tes chameaux, soit celle que tu as destinée à ton serviteur Isaac! Et par là je connaîtrai que tu uses de bonté envers mon seigneur.\\nIl n\\'avait pas encore fini de parler que sortit, sa cruche sur l\\'épaule, Rebecca, née de Bethuel, fils de Milca, femme de Nachor, frère d\\'Abraham.\\nC\\'était une jeune fille très belle de figure; elle était vierge, et aucun homme ne l\\'avait connue. Elle descendit à la source, remplit sa cruche, et remonta.\\nLe serviteur courut au-devant d\\'elle, et dit: Laisse-moi boire, je te prie, un peu d\\'eau de ta cruche.\\nElle répondit: Bois, mon seigneur. Et elle s\\'empressa d\\'abaisser sa cruche sur sa main, et de lui donner à boire.\\nQuand elle eut achevé de lui donner à boire, elle dit: Je puiserai aussi pour tes chameaux, jusqu\\'à ce qu\\'ils aient assez bu.\\nEt elle s\\'empressa de vider sa cruche dans l\\'abreuvoir, et courut encore au puits pour puiser; et elle puisa pour tous les chameaux.\\nL\\'homme la regardait avec étonnement et sans rien dire, pour voir si l\\'éternel faisait réussir son voyage, ou non.\\nQuand les chameaux eurent fini de boire, l\\'homme prit un anneau d\\'or, du poids d\\'un demi-sicle, et deux bracelets, du poids de dix sicles d\\'or.\\nEt il dit: De qui es-tu fille? dis-le moi, je te prie. Y a-t-il dans la maison de ton père de la place pour passer la nuit?\\nElle répondit: Je suis fille de Bethuel, fils de Milca et de Nachor.\\nElle lui dit encore: Il y a chez nous de la paille et du fourrage en abondance, et aussi de la place pour passer la nuit.\\nAlors l\\'homme s\\'inclina et se prosterna devant l\\'éternel,\\nen disant: Béni soit l\\'éternel, le Dieu de mon seigneur Abraham, qui n\\'a pas renoncé à sa miséricorde et à sa fidélité envers mon seigneur! Moi-même, l\\'éternel m\\'a conduit à la maison des frères de mon seigneur.\\nLa jeune fille courut raconter ces choses à la maison de sa mère.\\nRebecca avait un frère, nommé Laban. Et Laban courut dehors vers l\\'homme, près de la source.\\nIl avait vu l\\'anneau et les bracelets aux mains de sa soeur, et il avait entendu les paroles de Rebecca, sa soeur, disant: Ainsi m\\'a parlé l\\'homme. Il vint donc à cet homme qui se tenait auprès des chameaux, vers la source,\\net il dit: Viens, béni de l\\'éternel! Pourquoi resterais-tu dehors? J\\'ai préparé la maison, et une place pour les chameaux.\\nL\\'homme arriva à la maison. Laban fit décharger les chameaux, et il donna de la paille et du fourrage aux chameaux, et de l\\'eau pour laver les pieds de l\\'homme et les pieds des gens qui étaient avec lui.\\nPuis, il lui servit à manger. Mais il dit: Je ne mangerai point, avant d\\'avoir dit ce que j\\'ai à dire. Parle! dit Laban.\\nAlors il dit: Je suis serviteur d\\'Abraham.\\nL\\'éternel a comblé de bénédictions mon seigneur, qui est devenu puissant. Il lui a donné des brebis et des boeufs, de l\\'argent et de l\\'or, des serviteurs et des servantes, des chameaux et des ânes.\\nSara, la femme de mon seigneur, a enfanté dans sa vieillesse un fils à mon seigneur; et il lui a donné tout ce qu\\'il possède.\\nMon seigneur m\\'a fait jurer, en disant: Tu ne prendras pas pour mon fils une femme parmi les filles des Cananéens, dans le pays desquels j\\'habite;\\nmais tu iras dans la maison de mon père et de ma famille prendre une femme pour mon fils.\\nJ\\'ai dit à mon seigneur: Peut-être la femme ne voudra-t-elle pas me suivre.\\nEt il m\\'a répondu: L\\'éternel, devant qui j\\'ai marché, enverra son ange avec toi, et fera réussir ton voyage; et tu prendras pour mon fils une femme de la famille et de la maison de mon père.\\nTu seras dégagé du serment que tu me fais, quand tu auras été vers ma famille; si on ne te l\\'accorde pas, tu seras dégagé du serment que tu me fais.\\nJe suis arrivé aujourd\\'hui à la source, et j\\'ai dit: éternel, Dieu de mon seigneur Abraham, si tu daignes faire réussir le voyage que j\\'accomplis,\\nvoici, je me tiens près de la source d\\'eau, et que la jeune fille qui sortira pour puiser, à qui je dirai: Laisse-moi boire, je te prie, un peu d\\'eau de ta cruche, et qui me répondra:\\nBois toi-même, et je puiserai aussi pour tes chameaux, que cette jeune fille soit la femme que l\\'éternel a destinée au fils de mon seigneur!\\nAvant que j\\'eusse fini de parler en mon coeur, voici, Rebecca est sortie, sa cruche sur l\\'épaule; elle est descendue à la source, et a puisé. Je lui ai dit: Donne-moi à boire, je te prie.\\nElle s\\'est empressée d\\'abaisser sa cruche de dessus son épaule, et elle a dit: Bois, et je donnerai aussi à boire à tes chameaux. J\\'ai bu, et elle a aussi donné à boire à mes chameaux.\\nJe l\\'ai interrogée, et j\\'ai dit: De qui es-tu fille? Elle a répondu: Je suis fille de Bethuel, fils de Nachor et de Milca. J\\'ai mis l\\'anneau à son nez, et les bracelets à ses mains.\\nPuis je me suis incliné et prosterné devant l\\'éternel, et j\\'ai béni L\\'éternel, le Dieu de mon seigneur Abraham, qui m\\'a conduit fidèlement, afin que je prisse la fille du frère de mon seigneur pour son fils.\\nMaintenant, si vous voulez user de bienveillance et de fidélité envers mon seigneur, déclarez-le-moi; sinon, déclarez-le-moi, et je me tournerai à droite ou à gauche.\\nLaban et Bethuel répondirent, et dirent: C\\'est de l\\'éternel que la chose vient; nous ne pouvons te parler ni en mal ni en bien.\\nVoici Rebecca devant toi; prends et va, et qu\\'elle soit la femme du fils de ton seigneur, comme l\\'éternel l\\'a dit.\\nLorsque le serviteur d\\'Abraham eut entendu leurs paroles, il se prosterna en terre devant l\\'éternel.\\nEt le serviteur sortit des objets d\\'argent, des objets d\\'or, et des vêtements, qu\\'il donna à Rebecca; il fit aussi de riches présents à son frère et à sa mère.\\nAprès quoi, ils mangèrent et burent, lui et les gens qui étaient avec lui, et ils passèrent la nuit. Le matin, quand ils furent levés, le serviteur dit: Laissez-moi retournez vers mon seigneur.\\nLe frère et la mère dirent: Que la jeune fille reste avec nous quelque temps encore, une dizaine de jours; ensuite, tu partiras.\\nIl leur répondit: Ne me retardez pas, puisque l\\'éternel a fait réussir mon voyage; laissez-moi partir, et que j\\'aille vers mon seigneur.\\nAlors ils répondirent: Appelons la jeune fille et consultons-la.\\nIls appelèrent donc Rebecca, et lui dirent: Veux-tu aller avec cet homme? Elle répondit: J\\'irai.\\nEt ils laissèrent partir Rebecca, leur soeur, et sa nourrice, avec le serviteur d\\'Abraham et ses gens.\\nIls bénirent Rebecca, et lui dirent: O notre soeur, puisse-tu devenir des milliers de myriades, et que ta postérité possède la porte de ses ennemis!\\nRebecca se leva, avec ses servantes; elles montèrent sur les chameaux, et suivirent l\\'homme. Et le serviteur emmena Rebecca, et partit.\\nCependant Isaac était revenu du puits de Lachaï roï, et il habitait dans le pays du midi.\\nUn soir qu\\'Isaac était sorti pour méditer dans les champs, il leva les yeux, et regarda; et voici, des chameaux arrivaient.\\nRebecca leva aussi les yeux, vit Isaac, et descendit de son chameau.\\nElle dit au serviteur: Qui est cet homme, qui vient dans les champs à notre rencontre? Et le serviteur répondit: C\\'est mon seigneur. Alors elle prit son voile, et se couvrit.\\nLe serviteur raconta à Isaac toutes les choses qu\\'il avait faites.\\nIsaac conduisit Rebecca dans la tente de Sara, sa mère; il prit Rebecca, qui devint sa femme, et il l\\'aima. Ainsi fut consolé Isaac, après avoir perdu sa mère.\\nAbraham prit encore une femme, nommée Ketura.\\nElle lui enfanta Zimran, Jokschan, Medan, Madian, Jischbak et Schuach.\\nJokschan engendra Séba et Dedan. Les fils de Dedan furent les Aschurim, les Letuschim et les Leummim.\\nLes fils de Madian furent épha, épher, Hénoc, Abida et Eldaa. -Ce sont là tous les fils de Ketura.\\nAbraham donna tous ses biens à Isaac.\\nIl fit des dons aux fils de ses concubines; et, tandis qu\\'il vivait encore, il les envoya loin de son fils Isaac du côté de l\\'orient, dans le pays d\\'Orient.\\nVoici les jours des années de la vie d\\'Abraham: il vécut cent soixante quinze ans.\\nAbraham expira et mourut, après une heureuse vieillesse, âgé et rassasié de jours, et il fut recueilli auprès de son peuple.\\nIsaac et Ismaël, ses fils, l\\'enterrèrent dans la caverne de Macpéla, dans le champ d\\'éphron, fils de Tsochar, le Héthien, vis-à-vis de Mamré.\\nC\\'est le champ qu\\'Abraham avait acquis des fils de Heth. Là furent enterrés Abraham et Sara, sa femme.\\nAprès la mort d\\'Abraham, Dieu bénit Isaac, son fils. Il habitait près du puits de Lachaï roï.\\nVoici la postérité d\\'Ismaël, fils d\\'Abraham, qu\\'Agar, l\\'égyptienne, servante de Sara, avait enfanté à Abraham.\\nVoici les noms des fils d\\'Ismaël, par leurs noms, selon leurs générations: Nebajoth, premier-né d\\'Ismaël, Kédar, Adbeel, Mibsam,\\nMischma, Duma, Massa,\\nHadad, Théma, Jethur, Naphisch et Kedma.\\nCe sont là les fils d\\'Ismaël; ce sont là leurs noms, selon leurs parcs et leurs enclos. Ils furent les douze chefs de leurs peuples.\\nEt voici les années de la vie d\\'Ismaël: cent trente-sept ans. Il expira et mourut, et il fut recueilli auprès de son peuple.\\nSes fils habitèrent depuis Havila jusqu\\'à Schur, qui est en face de l\\'égypte, en allant vers l\\'Assyrie. Il s\\'établit en présence de tous ses frères.\\nVoici la postérité d\\'Isaac, fils d\\'Abraham.\\nAbraham engendra Isaac. Isaac était âgé de quarante ans, quand il prit pour femme Rebecca, fille de Bethuel, l\\'Araméen, de Paddan Aram, et soeur de Laban, l\\'Araméen.\\nIsaac implora l\\'éternel pour sa femme, car elle était stérile, et l\\'éternel l\\'exauça: Rebecca, sa femme, devint enceinte.\\nLes enfants se heurtaient dans son sein; et elle dit: S\\'il en est ainsi, pourquoi suis-je enceinte? Elle alla consulter l\\'éternel.\\nEt l\\'éternel lui dit: Deux nations sont dans ton ventre, et deux peuples se sépareront au sortir de tes entrailles; un de ces peuples sera plus fort que l\\'autre, et le plus grand sera assujetti au plus petit.\\nLes jours où elle devait accoucher s\\'accomplirent; et voici, il y avait deux jumeaux dans son ventre.\\nLe premier sortit entièrement roux, comme un manteau de poil; et on lui donna le nom d\\'ésaü.\\nEnsuite sortit son frère, dont la main tenait le talon d\\'ésaü; et on lui donna le nom de Jacob. Isaac était âgé de soixante ans, lorsqu\\'ils naquirent.\\nCes enfants grandirent. ésaü devint un habile chasseur, un homme des champs; mais Jacob fut un homme tranquille, qui restait sous les tentes.\\nIsaac aimait ésaü, parce qu\\'il mangeait du gibier; et Rebecca aimait Jacob.\\nComme Jacob faisait cuire un potage, ésaü revint des champs, accablé de fatigue.\\nEt ésaü dit à Jacob: Laisse-moi, je te prie, manger de ce roux, de ce roux-là, car je suis fatigué. C\\'est pour cela qu\\'on a donné à ésaü le nom d\\'édom.\\nJacob dit: Vends-moi aujourd\\'hui ton droit d\\'aînesse.\\nésaü répondit: Voici, je m\\'en vais mourir; à quoi me sert ce droit d\\'aînesse?\\nEt Jacob dit: Jure-le moi d\\'abord. Il le lui jura, et il vendit son droit d\\'aînesse à Jacob.\\nAlors Jacob donna à ésaü du pain et du potage de lentilles. Il mangea et but, puis se leva et s\\'en alla. C\\'est ainsi qu\\'ésaü méprisa le droit d\\'aînesse.\\nIl y eut une famine dans le pays, outre la première famine qui eut lieu du temps d\\'Abraham; et Isaac alla vers Abimélec, roi des Philistins, à Guérar.\\nL\\'éternel lui apparut, et dit: Ne descends pas en égypte, demeure dans le pays que je te dirai.\\nSéjourne dans ce pays-ci: je serai avec toi, et je te bénirai, car je donnerai toutes ces contrées à toi et à ta postérité, et je tiendrai le serment que j\\'ai fait à Abraham, ton père.\\nJe multiplierai ta postérité comme les étoiles du ciel; je donnerai à ta postérité toutes ces contrées; et toutes les nations de la terre seront bénies en ta postérité,\\nparce qu\\'Abraham a obéi à ma voix, et qu\\'il a observé mes ordres, mes commandements, mes statuts et mes lois.\\nEt Isaac resta à Guérar.\\nLorsque les gens du lieu faisaient des questions sur sa femme, il disait: C\\'est ma soeur; car il craignait, en disant ma femme, que les gens du lieu ne le tuassent, parce que Rebecca était belle de figure.\\nComme son séjour se prolongeait, il arriva qu\\'Abimélec, roi des Philistins, regardant par la fenêtre, vit Isaac qui plaisantait avec Rebecca, sa femme.\\nAbimélec fit appeler Isaac, et dit: Certainement, c\\'est ta femme. Comment as-tu pu dire: C\\'est ma soeur? Isaac lui répondit: J\\'ai parlé ainsi, de peur de mourir à cause d\\'elle.\\nEt Abimélec dit: Qu\\'est-ce que tu nous as fait? Peu s\\'en est fallu que quelqu\\'un du peuple n\\'ait couché avec ta femme, et tu nous aurais rendus coupables.\\nAlors Abimélec fit cette ordonnance pour tout le peuple: Celui qui touchera à cet homme ou à sa femme sera mis à mort.\\nIsaac sema dans ce pays, et il recueillit cette année le centuple; car l\\'éternel le bénit.\\nCet homme devint riche, et il alla s\\'enrichissant de plus en plus, jusqu\\'à ce qu\\'il devint fort riche.\\nIl avait des troupeaux de menu bétail et des troupeaux de gros bétail, et un grand nombre de serviteurs: aussi les Philistins lui portèrent envie.\\nTous les puits qu\\'avaient creusés les serviteurs de son père, du temps d\\'Abraham, son père, les Philistins les comblèrent et les remplirent de poussière.\\nEt Abimélec dit à Isaac: Va-t-en de chez nous, car tu es beaucoup plus puissant que nous.\\nIsaac partit de là, et campa dans la vallée de Guérar, où il s\\'établit.\\nIsaac creusa de nouveau les puits d\\'eau qu\\'on avait creusés du temps d\\'Abraham, son père, et qu\\'avaient comblés les Philistins après la mort d\\'Abraham; et il leur donna les mêmes noms que son père leur avait donnés.\\nLes serviteurs d\\'Isaac creusèrent encore dans la vallée, et y trouvèrent un puits d\\'eau vive.\\nLes bergers de Guérar querellèrent les bergers d\\'Isaac, en disant: L\\'eau est à nous. Et il donna au puits le nom d\\'ések, parce qu\\'ils s\\'étaient disputés avec lui.\\nSes serviteurs creusèrent un autre puits, au sujet duquel on chercha aussi une querelle; et il l\\'appela Sitna.\\nIl se transporta de là, et creusa un autre puits, pour lequel on ne chercha pas querelle; et il l\\'appela Rehoboth, car, dit-il, l\\'éternel nous a maintenant mis au large, et nous prospérerons dans le pays.\\nIl remonta de là à Beer Schéba.\\nL\\'éternel lui apparut dans la nuit, et dit: Je suis le Dieu d\\'Abraham, ton père; ne crains point, car je suis avec toi; je te bénirai, et je multiplierai ta postérité, à cause d\\'Abraham, mon serviteur.\\nIl bâtit là un autel, invoqua le nom de l\\'éternel, et y dressa sa tente. Et les serviteurs d\\'Isaac y creusèrent un puits.\\nAbimélec vint de Guérar auprès de lui, avec Ahuzath, son ami, et Picol, chef de son armée.\\nIsaac leur dit: Pourquoi venez-vous vers moi, puisque vous me haïssez et que vous m\\'avez renvoyé de chez vous?\\nIls répondirent: Nous voyons que l\\'éternel est avec toi. C\\'est pourquoi nous disons: Qu\\'il y ait un serment entre nous, entre nous et toi, et que nous fassions alliance avec toi!\\nJure que tu ne nous feras aucun mal, de même que nous ne t\\'avons point maltraité, que nous t\\'avons fait seulement du bien, et que nous t\\'avons laissé partir en paix. Tu es maintenant béni de l\\'éternel.\\nIsaac leur fit un festin, et ils mangèrent et burent.\\nIls se levèrent de bon matin, et se lièrent l\\'un à l\\'autre par un serment. Isaac les laissa partir, et ils le quittèrent en paix.\\nCe même jour, des serviteurs d\\'Isaac vinrent lui parler du puits qu\\'ils creusaient, et lui dirent: Nous avons trouvé de l\\'eau.\\nEt il l\\'appela Schiba. C\\'est pourquoi on a donné à la ville le nom de Beer Schéba, jusqu\\'à ce jour.\\nésaü, âgé de quarante ans, prit pour femmes Judith, fille de Beéri, le Héthien, et Basmath, fille d\\'élon, le Héthien.\\nElles furent un sujet d\\'amertume pour le coeur d\\'Isaac et de Rebecca.\\nIsaac devenait vieux, et ses yeux s\\'étaient affaiblis au point qu\\'il ne voyait plus. Alors il appela ésaü, son fils aîné, et lui dit: Mon fils! Et il lui répondit: Me voici!\\nIsaac dit: Voici donc, je suis vieux, je ne connais pas le jour de ma mort.\\nMaintenant donc, je te prie, prends tes armes, ton carquois et ton arc, va dans les champs, et chasse-moi du gibier.\\nFais-moi un mets comme j\\'aime, et apporte-le-moi à manger, afin que mon âme te bénisse avant que je meure.\\nRebecca écouta ce qu\\'Isaac disait à ésaü, son fils. Et ésaü s\\'en alla dans les champs, pour chasser du gibier et pour le rapporter.\\nPuis Rebecca dit à Jacob, son fils: Voici, j\\'ai entendu ton père qui parlait ainsi à ésaü, ton frère:\\nApporte-moi du gibier et fais-moi un mets que je mangerai; et je te bénirai devant l\\'éternel avant ma mort.\\nMaintenant, mon fils, écoute ma voix à l\\'égard de ce que je te commande.\\nVa me prendre au troupeau deux bons chevreaux; j\\'en ferai pour ton père un mets comme il aime;\\net tu le porteras à manger à ton père, afin qu\\'il te bénisse avant sa mort.\\nJacob répondit à sa mère: Voici, ésaü, mon frère, est velu, et je n\\'ai point de poil.\\nPeut-être mon père me touchera-t-il, et je passerai à ses yeux pour un menteur, et je ferai venir sur moi la malédiction, et non la bénédiction.\\nSa mère lui dit: Que cette malédiction, mon fils, retombe sur moi! écoute seulement ma voix, et va me les prendre.\\nJacob alla les prendre, et les apporta à sa mère, qui fit un mets comme son père aimait.\\nEnsuite, Rebecca prit les vêtements d\\'ésaü, son fils aîné, les plus beaux qui se trouvaient à la maison, et elle les fit mettre à Jacob, son fils cadet.\\nElle couvrit ses mains de la peau des chevreaux, et son cou qui était sans poil.\\nEt elle plaça dans la main de Jacob, son fils, le mets et le pain qu\\'elle avait préparés.\\nIl vint vers son père, et dit: Mon père! Et Isaac dit: Me voici! qui es-tu, mon fils?\\nJacob répondit à son père: Je suis ésaü, ton fils aîné; j\\'ai fait ce que tu m\\'as dit. Lève-toi, je te prie, assieds-toi, et mange de mon gibier, afin que ton âme me bénisse.\\nIsaac dit à son fils: Eh quoi! tu en as déjà trouvé, mon fils! Et Jacob répondit: C\\'est que l\\'éternel, ton Dieu, l\\'a fait venir devant moi.\\nIsaac dit à Jacob: Approche donc, et que je te touche, mon fils, pour savoir si tu es mon fils ésaü, ou non.\\nJacob s\\'approcha d\\'Isaac, son père, qui le toucha, et dit: La voix est la voix de Jacob, mais les mains sont les mains d\\'ésaü.\\nIl ne le reconnut pas, parce que ses mains étaient velues, comme les mains d\\'ésaü, son frère; et il le bénit.\\nIl dit: C\\'est toi qui es mon fils ésaü? Et Jacob répondit: C\\'est moi.\\nIsaac dit: Sers-moi, et que je mange du gibier de mon fils, afin que mon âme te bénisse. Jacob le servit, et il mangea; il lui apporta aussi du vin, et il but.\\nAlors Isaac, son père, lui dit: Approche donc, et baise-moi, mon fils.\\nJacob s\\'approcha, et le baisa. Isaac sentit l\\'odeur de ses vêtements; puis il le bénit, et dit: Voici, l\\'odeur de mon fils est comme l\\'odeur d\\'un champ que l\\'éternel a béni.\\nQue Dieu te donne de la rosée du ciel Et de la graisse de la terre, Du blé et du vin en abondance!\\nQue des peuples te soient soumis, Et que des nations se prosternent devant toi! Sois le maître de tes frères, Et que les fils de ta mère se prosternent devant toi! Maudit soit quiconque te maudira, Et béni soit quiconque te bénira.\\nIsaac avait fini de bénir Jacob, et Jacob avait à peine quitté son père Isaac, qu\\'ésaü, son frère, revint de la chasse.\\nIl fit aussi un mets, qu\\'il porta à son père; et il dit à son père: Que mon père se lève et mange du gibier de son fils, afin que ton âme me bénisse!\\nIsaac, son père, lui dit: Qui es-tu? Et il répondit: Je suis ton fils aîné, ésaü.\\nIsaac fut saisi d\\'une grande, d\\'une violente émotion, et il dit: Qui est donc celui qui a chassé du gibier, et me l\\'a apporté? J\\'ai mangé de tout avant que tu vinsses, et je l\\'ai béni. Aussi sera-t-il béni.\\nLorsque ésaü entendit les paroles de son père, il poussa de forts cris, pleins d\\'amertume, et il dit à son père: Bénis-moi aussi, mon père!\\nIsaac dit: Ton frère est venu avec ruse, et il a enlevé ta bénédiction.\\nésaü dit: Est-ce parce qu\\'on l\\'a appelé du nom de Jacob qu\\'il m\\'a supplanté deux fois? Il a enlevé mon droit d\\'aînesse, et voici maintenant qu\\'il vient d\\'enlever ma bénédiction. Et il dit: N\\'as-tu point réservé de bénédiction pour moi?\\nIsaac répondit, et dit à ésaü: Voici, je l\\'ai établi ton maître, et je lui ai donné tous ses frères pour serviteurs, je l\\'ai pourvu de blé et de vin: que puis-je donc faire pour toi, mon fils?\\nésaü dit à son père: N\\'as-tu que cette seule bénédiction, mon père? Bénis-moi aussi, mon père! Et ésaü éleva la voix, et pleura.\\nIsaac, son père, répondit, et lui dit: Voici! Ta demeure sera privée de la graisse de la terre Et de la rosée du ciel, d\\'en haut.\\nTu vivras de ton épée, Et tu seras asservi à ton frère; Mais en errant librement çà et là, Tu briseras son joug de dessus ton cou.\\nésaü conçut de la haine contre Jacob, à cause de la bénédiction dont son père l\\'avait béni; et ésaü disait en son coeur: Les jours du deuil de mon père vont approcher, et je tuerai Jacob, mon frère.\\nOn rapporta à Rebecca les paroles d\\'ésaü, son fils aîné. Elle fit alors appeler Jacob, son fils cadet, et elle lui dit: Voici, ésaü, ton frère, veut tirer vengeance de toi, en te tuant.\\nMaintenant, mon fils, écoute ma voix! Lève-toi, fuis chez Laban, mon frère, à Charan;\\net reste auprès de lui quelque temps,\\njusqu\\'à ce que la fureur de ton frère s\\'apaise, jusqu\\'à ce que la colère de ton frère se détourne de toi, et qu\\'il oublie ce que tu lui as fait. Alors je te ferai revenir. Pourquoi serais-je privée de vous deux en un même jour?\\nRebecca dit à Isaac: Je suis dégoûtée de la vie, à cause des filles de Heth. Si Jacob prend une femme, comme celles-ci, parmi les filles de Heth, parmi les filles du pays, à quoi me sert la vie?\\nIsaac appela Jacob, le bénit, et lui donna cet ordre: Tu ne prendras pas une femme parmi les filles de Canaan.\\nLève-toi, va à Paddan Aram, à la maison de Bethuel, père de ta mère, et prends-y une femme d\\'entre les filles de Laban, frère de ta mère.\\nQue le Dieu tout puissant te bénisse, te rende fécond et te multiplie, afin que tu deviennes une multitude de peuples!\\nQu\\'il te donne la bénédiction d\\'Abraham, à toi et à ta postérité avec toi, afin que tu possèdes le pays où tu habites comme étranger, et qu\\'il a donné à Abraham!\\nEt Isaac fit partir Jacob, qui s\\'en alla à Paddan Aram, auprès de Laban, fils de Bethuel, l\\'Araméen, frère de Rebecca, mère de Jacob et d\\'ésaü.\\nésaü vit qu\\'Isaac avait béni Jacob, et qu\\'il l\\'avait envoyé à Paddan Aram pour y prendre une femme, et qu\\'en le bénissant il lui avait donné cet ordre: Tu ne prendras pas une femme parmi les filles de Canaan.\\nIl vit que Jacob avait obéi à son père et à sa mère, et qu\\'il était parti pour Paddan Aram.\\nésaü comprit ainsi que les filles de Canaan déplaisaient à Isaac, son père.\\nEt ésaü s\\'en alla vers Ismaël. Il prit pour femme, outre les femmes qu\\'il avait, Mahalath, fille d\\'Ismaël, fils d\\'Abraham, et soeur de Nebajoth.\\nJacob partit de Beer Schéba, et s\\'en alla à Charan.\\nIl arriva dans un lieu où il passa la nuit; car le soleil était couché. Il y prit une pierre, dont il fit son chevet, et il se coucha dans ce lieu-là.\\nIl eut un songe. Et voici, une échelle était appuyée sur la terre, et son sommet touchait au ciel. Et voici, les anges de Dieu montaient et descendaient par cette échelle.\\nEt voici, l\\'éternel se tenait au-dessus d\\'elle; et il dit: Je suis l\\'éternel, le Dieu d\\'Abraham, ton père, et le Dieu d\\'Isaac. La terre sur laquelle tu es couché, je la donnerai à toi et à ta postérité.\\nTa postérité sera comme la poussière de la terre; tu t\\'étendras à l\\'occident et à l\\'orient, au septentrion et au midi; et toutes les familles de la terre seront bénies en toi et en ta postérité.\\nVoici, je suis avec toi, je te garderai partout où tu iras, et je te ramènerai dans ce pays; car je ne t\\'abandonnerai point, que je n\\'aie exécuté ce que je te dis.\\nJacob s\\'éveilla de son sommeil et il dit: Certainement, l\\'éternel est en ce lieu, et moi, je ne le savais pas!\\nIl eut peur, et dit: Que ce lieu est redoutable! C\\'est ici la maison de Dieu, c\\'est ici la porte des cieux!\\nEt Jacob se leva de bon matin; il prit la pierre dont il avait fait son chevet, il la dressa pour monument, et il versa de l\\'huile sur son sommet.\\nIl donna à ce lieu le nom de Béthel; mais la ville s\\'appelait auparavant Luz.\\nJacob fit un voeu, en disant: Si Dieu est avec moi et me garde pendant ce voyage que je fais, s\\'il me donne du pain à manger et des habits pour me vêtir,\\net si je retourne en paix à la maison de mon père, alors l\\'éternel sera mon Dieu;\\ncette pierre, que j\\'ai dressée pour monument, sera la maison de Dieu; et je te donnerai la dîme de tout ce que tu me donneras.\\nJacob se mit en marche, et s\\'en alla au pays des fils de l\\'Orient.\\nIl regarda. Et voici, il y avait un puits dans les champs; et voici, il y avait à côté trois troupeaux de brebis qui se reposaient, car c\\'était à ce puits qu\\'on abreuvait les troupeaux. Et la pierre sur l\\'ouverture du puits était grande.\\nTous les troupeaux se rassemblaient là; on roulait la pierre de dessus l\\'ouverture du puits, on abreuvait les troupeaux, et l\\'on remettait la pierre à sa place sur l\\'ouverture du puits.\\nJacob dit aux bergers: Mes frères, d\\'où êtes-vous? Ils répondirent: Nous sommes de Charan.\\nIl leur dit: Connaissez-vous Laban, fils de Nachor? Ils répondirent: Nous le connaissons.\\nIl leur dit: Est-il en bonne santé? Ils répondirent: Il est en bonne santé; et voici Rachel, sa fille, qui vient avec le troupeau.\\nIl dit: Voici, il est encore grand jour, et il n\\'est pas temps de rassembler les troupeaux; abreuvez les brebis, puis allez, et faites-les paître.\\nIls répondirent: Nous ne le pouvons pas, jusqu\\'à ce que tous les troupeaux soient rassemblés; c\\'est alors qu\\'on roule la pierre de dessus l\\'ouverture du puits, et qu\\'on abreuve les brebis.\\nComme il leur parlait encore, survint Rachel avec le troupeau de son père; car elle était bergère.\\nLorsque Jacob vit Rachel, fille de Laban, frère de sa mère, et le troupeau de Laban, frère de sa mère, il s\\'approcha, roula la pierre de dessus l\\'ouverture du puits, et abreuva le troupeau de Laban, frère de sa mère.\\nEt Jacob baisa Rachel, il éleva la voix et pleura.\\nJacob apprit à Rachel qu\\'il était parent de son père, qu\\'il était fils de Rebecca. Et elle courut l\\'annoncer à son père.\\nDès que Laban eut entendu parler de Jacob, fils de sa soeur, il courut au-devant de lui, il l\\'embrassa et le baisa, et il le fit venir dans sa maison. Jacob raconta à Laban toutes ces choses.\\nEt Laban lui dit: Certainement, tu es mon os et ma chair. Jacob demeura un mois chez Laban.\\nPuis Laban dit à Jacob: Parce que tu es mon parent, me serviras-tu pour rien? Dis-moi quel sera ton salaire.\\nOr, Laban avait deux filles: l\\'aînée s\\'appelait Léa, et la cadette Rachel.\\nLéa avait les yeux délicats; mais Rachel était belle de taille et belle de figure.\\nJacob aimait Rachel, et il dit: Je te servirai sept ans pour Rachel, ta fille cadette.\\nEt Laban dit: J\\'aime mieux te la donner que de la donner à un autre homme. Reste chez moi!\\nAinsi Jacob servit sept années pour Rachel: et elles furent à ses yeux comme quelques jours, parce qu\\'il l\\'aimait.\\nEnsuite Jacob dit à Laban: Donne-moi ma femme, car mon temps est accompli: et j\\'irai vers elle.\\nLaban réunit tous les gens du lieu, et fit un festin.\\nLe soir, il prit Léa, sa fille, et l\\'amena vers Jacob, qui s\\'approcha d\\'elle.\\nEt Laban donna pour servante à Léa, sa fille, Zilpa, sa servante.\\nLe lendemain matin, voilà que c\\'était Léa. Alors Jacob dit à Laban: Qu\\'est-ce que tu m\\'as fait? N\\'est-ce pas pour Rachel que j\\'ai servi chez toi? Pourquoi m\\'as-tu trompé?\\nLaban dit: Ce n\\'est point la coutume dans ce lieu de donner la cadette avant l\\'aînée.\\nAchève la semaine avec celle-ci, et nous te donnerons aussi l\\'autre pour le service que tu feras encore chez moi pendant sept nouvelles années.\\nJacob fit ainsi, et il acheva la semaine avec Léa; puis Laban lui donna pour femme Rachel, sa fille.\\nEt Laban donna pour servante à Rachel, sa fille, Bilha, sa servante.\\nJacob alla aussi vers Rachel, qu\\'il aimait plus que Léa; et il servit encore chez Laban pendant sept nouvelles années.\\nL\\'éternel vit que Léa n\\'était pas aimée; et il la rendit féconde, tandis que Rachel était stérile.\\nLéa devint enceinte, et enfanta un fils, à qui elle donna le nom de Ruben; car elle dit: L\\'éternel a vu mon humiliation, et maintenant mon mari m\\'aimera.\\nElle devint encore enceinte, et enfanta un fils, et elle dit: L\\'éternel a entendu que je n\\'étais pas aimée, et il m\\'a aussi accordé celui-ci. Et elle lui donna le nom de Siméon.\\nElle devint encore enceinte, et enfanta un fils, et elle dit: Pour cette fois, mon mari s\\'attachera à moi; car je lui ai enfanté trois fils. C\\'est pourquoi on lui donna le nom de Lévi.\\nElle devint encore enceinte, et enfanta un fils, et elle dit: Cette fois, je louerai l\\'éternel. C\\'est pourquoi elle lui donna le nom de Juda. Et elle cessa d\\'enfanter.\\nLorsque Rachel vit qu\\'elle ne donnait point d\\'enfants à Jacob, elle porta envie à sa soeur, et elle dit à Jacob: Donne-moi des enfants, ou je meurs!\\nLa colère de Jacob s\\'enflamma contre Rachel, et il dit: Suis-je à la place de Dieu, qui t\\'empêche d\\'être féconde?\\nElle dit: Voici ma servante Bilha; va vers elle; qu\\'elle enfante sur mes genoux, et que par elle j\\'aie aussi des fils.\\nEt elle lui donna pour femme Bilha, sa servante; et Jacob alla vers elle.\\nBilha devint enceinte, et enfanta un fils à Jacob.\\nRachel dit: Dieu m\\'a rendu justice, il a entendu ma voix, et il m\\'a donné un fils. C\\'est pourquoi elle l\\'appela du nom de Dan.\\nBilha, servante de Rachel, devint encore enceinte, et enfanta un second fils à Jacob.\\nRachel dit: J\\'ai lutté divinement contre ma soeur, et j\\'ai vaincu. Et elle l\\'appela du nom de Nephthali.\\nLéa voyant qu\\'elle avait cessé d\\'enfanter, prit Zilpa, sa servante, et la donna pour femme à Jacob.\\nZilpa, servante de Léa, enfanta un fils à Jacob.\\nLéa dit: Quel bonheur! Et elle l\\'appela du nom de Gad.\\nZilpa, servante de Léa, enfanta un second fils à Jacob.\\nLéa dit: Que je suis heureuse! car les filles me diront heureuse. Et elle l\\'appela du nom d\\'Aser.\\nRuben sortit au temps de la moisson des blés, et trouva des mandragores dans les champs. Il les apporta à Léa, sa mère. Alors Rachel dit à Léa: Donne moi, je te prie, des mandragores de ton fils.\\nElle lui répondit: Est-ce peu que tu aies pris mon mari, pour que tu prennes aussi les mandragores de mon fils? Et Rachel dit: Eh bien! il couchera avec toi cette nuit pour les mandragores de ton fils.\\nLe soir, comme Jacob revenait des champs, Léa sortit à sa rencontre, et dit: C\\'est vers moi que tu viendras, car je t\\'ai acheté pour les mandragores de mon fils. Et il coucha avec elle cette nuit.\\nDieu exauça Léa, qui devint enceinte, et enfanta un cinquième fils à Jacob.\\nLéa dit: Dieu m\\'a donné mon salaire parce que j\\'ai donné ma servante à mon mari. Et elle l\\'appela du nom d\\'Issacar.\\nLéa devint encore enceinte, et enfanta un sixième fils à Jacob.\\nLéa dit: Dieu m\\'a fait un beau don; cette fois, mon mari habitera avec moi, car je lui ai enfanté six fils. Et elle l\\'appela du nom de Zabulon.\\nEnsuite, elle enfanta une fille, qu\\'elle appela du nom de Dina.\\nDieu se souvint de Rachel, il l\\'exauça, et il la rendit féconde.\\nElle devint enceinte, et enfanta un fils, et elle dit: Dieu a enlevé mon opprobre.\\nEt elle lui donna le nom de Joseph, en disant: Que l\\'éternel m\\'ajoute un autre fils!\\nLorsque Rachel eut enfanté Joseph, Jacob dit à Laban: Laisse-moi partir, pour que je m\\'en aille chez moi, dans mon pays.\\nDonne-moi mes femmes et mes enfants, pour lesquels je t\\'ai servi, et je m\\'en irai; car tu sais quel service j\\'ai fait pour toi.\\nLaban lui dit: Puissé-je trouver grâce à tes yeux! Je vois bien que l\\'éternel m\\'a béni à cause de toi;\\nfixe-moi ton salaire, et je te le donnerai.\\nJacob lui dit: Tu sais comment je t\\'ai servi, et ce qu\\'est devenu ton troupeau avec moi;\\ncar le peu que tu avais avant moi s\\'est beaucoup accru, et l\\'éternel t\\'a béni sur mes pas. Maintenant, quand travaillerai-je aussi pour ma maison?\\nLaban dit: Que te donnerai-je? Et Jacob répondit: Tu ne me donneras rien. Si tu consens à ce que je vais te dire, je ferai paître encore ton troupeau, et je le garderai.\\nJe parcourrai aujourd\\'hui tout ton troupeau; mets à part parmi les brebis tout agneau tacheté et marqueté et tout agneau noir, et parmi les chèvres tout ce qui est marqueté et tacheté. Ce sera mon salaire.\\nMa droiture répondra pour moi demain, quand tu viendras voir mon salaire; tout ce qui ne sera pas tacheté et marqueté parmi les chèvres, et noir parmi les agneaux, ce sera de ma part un vol.\\nLaban dit: Eh bien! qu\\'il en soit selon ta parole.\\nCe même jour, il mit à part les boucs rayés et marquetés, toutes les chèvres tachetées et marquetées, toutes celles où il y avait du blanc, et tout ce qui était noir parmi les brebis. Il les remit entre les mains de ses fils.\\nPuis il mit l\\'espace de trois journées de chemin entre lui et Jacob; et Jacob fit paître le reste du troupeau de Laban.\\nJacob prit des branches vertes de peuplier, d\\'amandier et de platane; il y pela des bandes blanches, mettant à nu le blanc qui était sur les branches.\\nPuis il plaça les branches, qu\\'il avait pelées, dans les auges, dans les abreuvoirs, sous les yeux des brebis qui venaient boire, pour qu\\'elles entrassent en chaleur en venant boire.\\nLes brebis entraient en chaleur près des branches, et elles faisaient des petits rayés, tachetés et marquetés.\\nJacob séparait les agneaux, et il mettait ensemble ce qui était rayé et tout ce qui était noir dans le troupeau de Laban. Il se fit ainsi des troupeaux à part, qu\\'il ne réunit point au troupeau de Laban.\\nToutes les fois que les brebis vigoureuses entraient en chaleur, Jacob plaçait les branches dans les auges, sous les yeux des brebis, pour qu\\'elles entrassent en chaleur près des branches.\\nQuand les brebis étaient chétives, il ne les plaçait point; de sorte que les chétives étaient pour Laban, et les vigoureuses pour Jacob.\\nCet homme devint de plus en plus riche; il eut du menu bétail en abondance, des servantes et des serviteurs, des chameaux et des ânes.\\nJacob entendit les propos des fils de Laban, qui disaient: Jacob a pris tout ce qui était à notre père, et c\\'est avec le bien de notre père qu\\'il s\\'est acquis toute cette richesse.\\nJacob remarqua aussi le visage de Laban; et voici, il n\\'était plus envers lui comme auparavant.\\nAlors l\\'éternel dit à Jacob: Retourne au pays de tes pères et dans ton lieu de naissance, et je serai avec toi.\\nJacob fit appeler Rachel et Léa, qui étaient aux champs vers son troupeau.\\nIl leur dit: Je vois, au visage de votre père, qu\\'il n\\'est plus envers moi comme auparavant; mais le Dieu de mon père a été avec moi.\\nVous savez vous-mêmes que j\\'ai servi votre père de tout mon pouvoir.\\nEt votre père s\\'est joué de moi, et a changé dix fois mon salaire; mais Dieu ne lui a pas permis de me faire du mal.\\nQuand il disait: Les tachetés seront ton salaire, toutes les brebis faisaient des petits tachetés. Et quand il disait: Les rayés seront ton salaire, toutes les brebis faisaient des petits rayés.\\nDieu a pris à votre père son troupeau, et me l\\'a donné.\\nAu temps où les brebis entraient en chaleur, je levai les yeux, et je vis en songe que les boucs qui couvraient les brebis étaient rayés, tachetés et marquetés.\\nEt l\\'ange de Dieu me dit en songe: Jacob! Je répondis: Me voici!\\nIl dit: Lève les yeux, et regarde: tous les boucs qui couvrent les brebis sont rayés, tachetés et marquetés; car j\\'ai vu tout ce que te fait Laban.\\nJe suis le Dieu de Béthel, où tu as oint un monument, où tu m\\'as fait un voeu. Maintenant, lève-toi, sors de ce pays, et retourne au pays de ta naissance.\\nRachel et Léa répondirent, et lui dirent: Avons-nous encore une part et un héritage dans la maison de notre père?\\nNe sommes-nous pas regardées par lui comme des étrangères, puisqu\\'il nous a vendues, et qu\\'il a mangé notre argent?\\nToute la richesse que Dieu a ôtée à notre père appartient à nous et à nos enfants. Fais maintenant tout ce que Dieu t\\'a dit.\\nJacob se leva, et il fit monter ses enfants et ses femmes sur les chameaux.\\nIl emmena tout son troupeau et tous les biens qu\\'il possédait, le troupeau qui lui appartenait, qu\\'il avait acquis à Paddan Aram; et il s\\'en alla vers Isaac, son père, au pays de Canaan.\\nTandis que Laban était allé tondre ses brebis, Rachel déroba les théraphim de son père;\\net Jacob trompa Laban, l\\'Araméen, en ne l\\'avertissant pas de sa fuite.\\nIl s\\'enfuit, avec tout ce qui lui appartenait; il se leva, traversa le fleuve, et se dirigea vers la montagne de Galaad.\\nLe troisième jour, on annonça à Laban que Jacob s\\'était enfui.\\nIl prit avec lui ses frères, le poursuivit sept journées de marche, et l\\'atteignit à la montagne de Galaad.\\nMais Dieu apparut la nuit en songe à Laban, l\\'Araméen, et lui dit: Garde-toi de parler à Jacob ni en bien ni en mal!\\nLaban atteignit donc Jacob. Jacob avait dressé sa tente sur la montagne; Laban dressa aussi la sienne, avec ses frères, sur la montagne de Galaad.\\nAlors Laban dit à Jacob: Qu\\'as-tu fait? Pourquoi m\\'as-tu trompé, et emmènes-tu mes filles comme des captives par l\\'épée?\\nPourquoi as-tu pris la fuite en cachette, m\\'as-tu trompé, et ne m\\'as-tu point averti? Je t\\'aurais laissé partir au milieu des réjouissances et des chants, au son du tambourin et de la harpe.\\nTu ne m\\'as pas permis d\\'embrasser mes fils et mes filles! C\\'est en insensé que tu as agi.\\nMa main est assez forte pour vous faire du mal; mais le Dieu de votre père m\\'a dit hier: Garde-toi de parler à Jacob ni en bien ni en mal!\\nMaintenant que tu es parti, parce que tu languissais après la maison de ton père, pourquoi as-tu dérobé mes dieux?\\nJacob répondit, et dit à Laban: J\\'avais de la crainte à la pensée que tu m\\'enlèverais peut-être tes filles.\\nMais périsse celui auprès duquel tu trouveras tes dieux! En présence de nos frères, examine ce qui t\\'appartient chez moi, et prends-le. Jacob ne savait pas que Rachel les eût dérobés.\\nLaban entra dans la tente de Jacob, dans la tente de Léa, dans la tente des deux servantes, et il ne trouva rien. Il sortit de la tente de Léa, et entra dans la tente de Rachel.\\nRachel avait pris les théraphim, les avait mis sous le bât du chameau, et s\\'était assise dessus. Laban fouilla toute la tente, et ne trouva rien.\\nElle dit à son père: Que mon seigneur ne se fâche point, si je ne puis me lever devant toi, car j\\'ai ce qui est ordinaire aux femmes. Il chercha, et ne trouva point les théraphim.\\nJacob s\\'irrita, et querella Laban. Il reprit la parole, et lui dit: Quel est mon crime, quel est mon péché, que tu me poursuives avec tant d\\'ardeur?\\nQuand tu as fouillé tous mes effets, qu\\'as-tu trouvé des effets de ta maison? Produis-le ici devant mes frères et tes frères, et qu\\'ils prononcent entre nous deux.\\nVoilà vingt ans que j\\'ai passés chez toi; tes brebis et tes chèvres n\\'ont point avorté, et je n\\'ai point mangé les béliers de ton troupeau.\\nJe ne t\\'ai point rapporté de bêtes déchirées, j\\'en ai payé le dommage; tu me redemandais ce qu\\'on me volait de jour et ce qu\\'on me volait de nuit.\\nLa chaleur me dévorait pendant le jour, et le froid pendant la nuit, et le sommeil fuyait de mes yeux.\\nVoilà vingt ans que j\\'ai passés dans ta maison; je t\\'ai servi quatorze ans pour tes deux filles, et six ans pour ton troupeau, et tu as changé dix fois mon salaire.\\nSi je n\\'eusse pas eu pour moi le Dieu de mon père, le Dieu d\\'Abraham, celui que craint Isaac, tu m\\'aurais maintenant renvoyé à vide. Dieu a vu ma souffrance et le travail de mes mains, et hier il a prononcé son jugement.\\nLaban répondit, et dit à Jacob: Ces filles sont mes filles, ces enfants sont mes enfants, ce troupeau est mon troupeau, et tout ce que tu vois est à moi. Et que puis-je faire aujourd\\'hui pour mes filles, ou pour leurs enfants qu\\'elles ont mis au monde?\\nViens, faisons alliance, moi et toi, et que cela serve de témoignage entre moi et toi!\\nJacob prit une pierre, et il la dressa pour monument.\\nJacob dit à ses frères: Ramassez des pierres. Ils prirent des pierres, et firent un monceau; et ils mangèrent là sur le monceau.\\nLaban l\\'appela Jegar Sahadutha, et Jacob l\\'appela Galed.\\nLaban dit: Que ce monceau serve aujourd\\'hui de témoignage entre moi et toi! C\\'est pourquoi on lui a donné le nom de Galed.\\nOn l\\'appelle aussi Mitspa, parce que Laban dit: Que l\\'éternel veille sur toi et sur moi, quand nous nous serons l\\'un et l\\'autre perdus de vue.\\nSi tu maltraites mes filles, et si tu prends encore d\\'autres femmes, ce n\\'est pas un homme qui sera avec nous, prends-y garde, c\\'est Dieu qui sera témoin entre moi et toi.\\nLaban dit à Jacob: Voici ce monceau, et voici ce monument que j\\'ai élevé entre moi et toi.\\nQue ce monceau soit témoin et que ce monument soit témoin que je n\\'irai point vers toi au delà de ce monceau, et que tu ne viendras point vers moi au delà de ce monceau et de ce monument, pour agir méchamment.\\nQue le Dieu d\\'Abraham et de Nachor, que le Dieu de leur père soit juge entre nous. Jacob jura par celui que craignait Isaac.\\nJacob offrit un sacrifice sur la montagne, et il invita ses frères à manger; ils mangèrent donc, et passèrent la nuit sur la montagne.\\nLaban se leva de bon matin, baisa ses fils et ses filles, et les bénit. Ensuite il partit pour retourner dans sa demeure.\\nJacob poursuivit son chemin; et des anges de Dieu le rencontrèrent.\\nEn les voyant, Jacob dit: C\\'est le camp de Dieu! Et il donna à ce lieu le nom de Mahanaïm.\\nJacob envoya devant lui des messagers à ésaü, son frère, au pays de Séir, dans le territoire d\\'édom.\\nIl leur donna cet ordre: Voici ce que vous direz à mon seigneur ésaü: Ainsi parle ton serviteur Jacob: J\\'ai séjourné chez Laban, et j\\'y suis resté jusqu\\'à présent;\\nj\\'ai des boeufs, des ânes, des brebis, des serviteurs et des servantes, et j\\'envoie l\\'annoncer à mon seigneur, pour trouver grâce à tes yeux.\\nLes messagers revinrent auprès de Jacob, en disant: Nous sommes allés vers ton frère ésaü; et il marche à ta rencontre, avec quatre cents hommes.\\nJacob fut très effrayé, et saisi d\\'angoisse. Il partagea en deux camps les gens qui étaient avec lui, les brebis, les boeufs et les chameaux;\\net il dit: Si ésaü vient contre l\\'un des camps et le bat, le camp qui restera pourra se sauver.\\nJacob dit: Dieu de mon père Abraham, Dieu de mon père Isaac, éternel, qui m\\'as dit: Retourne dans ton pays et dans ton lieu de naissance, et je te ferai du bien!\\nJe suis trop petit pour toutes les grâces et pour toute la fidélité dont tu as usé envers ton serviteur; car j\\'ai passé ce Jourdain avec mon bâton, et maintenant je forme deux camps.\\nDélivre-moi, je te prie, de la main de mon frère, de la main d\\'ésaü! car je crains qu\\'il ne vienne, et qu\\'il ne me frappe, avec la mère et les enfants.\\nEt toi, tu as dit: Je te ferai du bien, et je rendrai ta postérité comme le sable de la mer, si abondant qu\\'on ne saurait le compter.\\nC\\'est dans ce lieu-là que Jacob passa la nuit. Il prit de ce qu\\'il avait sous la main, pour faire un présent à ésaü, son frère:\\ndeux cents chèvres et vingt boucs, deux cents brebis et vingt béliers,\\ntrente femelles de chameaux avec leurs petits qu\\'elles allaitaient, quarante vaches et dix taureaux, vingt ânesses et dix ânes.\\nIl les remit à ses serviteurs, troupeau par troupeau séparément, et il dit à ses serviteurs: Passez devant moi, et mettez un intervalle entre chaque troupeau.\\nIl donna cet ordre au premier: Quand ésaü, mon frère, te rencontrera, et te demandera: A qui es-tu? où vas-tu? et à qui appartient ce troupeau devant toi?\\ntu répondras: A ton serviteur Jacob; c\\'est un présent envoyé à mon seigneur ésaü; et voici, il vient lui-même derrière nous.\\nIl donna le même ordre au second, au troisième, et à tous ceux qui suivaient les troupeaux: C\\'est ainsi que vous parlerez à mon seigneur ésaü, quand vous le rencontrerez.\\nVous direz: Voici, ton serviteur Jacob vient aussi derrière nous. Car il se disait: Je l\\'apaiserai par ce présent qui va devant moi; ensuite je le verrai en face, et peut-être m\\'accueillera-t-il favorablement.\\nLe présent passa devant lui; et il resta cette nuit-là dans le camp.\\nIl se leva la même nuit, prit ses deux femmes, ses deux servantes, et ses onze enfants, et passa le gué de Jabbok.\\nIl les prit, leur fit passer le torrent, et le fit passer à tout ce qui lui appartenait.\\nJacob demeura seul. Alors un homme lutta avec lui jusqu\\'au lever de l\\'aurore.\\nVoyant qu\\'il ne pouvait le vaincre, cet homme le frappa à l\\'emboîture de la hanche; et l\\'emboîture de la hanche de Jacob se démit pendant qu\\'il luttait avec lui.\\nIl dit: Laisse-moi aller, car l\\'aurore se lève. Et Jacob répondit: Je ne te laisserai point aller, que tu ne m\\'aies béni.\\nIl lui dit: Quel est ton nom? Et il répondit: Jacob.\\nIl dit encore: ton nom ne sera plus Jacob, mais tu seras appelé Israël; car tu as lutté avec Dieu et avec des hommes, et tu as été vainqueur.\\nJacob l\\'interrogea, en disant: Fais-moi je te prie, connaître ton nom. Il répondit: Pourquoi demandes-tu mon nom? Et il le bénit là.\\nJacob appela ce lieu du nom de Peniel: car, dit-il, j\\'ai vu Dieu face à face, et mon âme a été sauvée.\\nLe soleil se levait, lorsqu\\'il passa Peniel. Jacob boitait de la hanche.\\nC\\'est pourquoi jusqu\\'à ce jour, les enfants d\\'Israël ne mangent point le tendon qui est à l\\'emboîture de la hanche; car Dieu frappa Jacob à l\\'emboîture de la hanche, au tendon.\\nJacob leva les yeux, et regarda; et voici, ésaü arrivait, avec quatre cents hommes. Il répartit les enfants entre Léa, Rachel, et les deux servantes.\\nIl plaça en tête les servantes avec leurs enfants, puis Léa avec ses enfants, et enfin Rachel avec Joseph.\\nLui-même passa devant eux; et il se prosterna en terre sept fois, jusqu\\'à ce qu\\'il fût près de son frère.\\nésaü courut à sa rencontre; il l\\'embrassa, se jeta à son cou, et le baisa. Et ils pleurèrent.\\nésaü, levant les yeux, vit les femmes et les enfants, et il dit: Qui sont ceux que tu as là? Et Jacob répondit: Ce sont les enfants que Dieu a accordés à ton serviteur.\\nLes servantes s\\'approchèrent, elles et leurs enfants, et se prosternèrent;\\nLéa et ses enfants s\\'approchèrent aussi, et se prosternèrent; ensuite Joseph et Rachel s\\'approchèrent, et se prosternèrent.\\nésaü dit: A quoi destines-tu tout ce camp que j\\'ai rencontré? Et Jacob répondit: A trouver grâce aux yeux de mon seigneur.\\nésaü dit: Je suis dans l\\'abondance, mon frère; garde ce qui est à toi.\\nEt Jacob répondit: Non, je te prie, si j\\'ai trouvé grâce à tes yeux, accepte de ma main mon présent; car c\\'est pour cela que j\\'ai regardé ta face comme on regarde la face de Dieu, et tu m\\'as accueilli favorablement.\\nAccepte donc mon présent qui t\\'a été offert, puisque Dieu m\\'a comblé de grâces, et que je ne manque de rien. Il insista auprès de lui, et ésaü accepta.\\nésaü dit: Partons, mettons-nous en route; j\\'irai devant toi.\\nJacob lui répondit: Mon seigneur sait que les enfants sont délicats, et que j\\'ai des brebis et des vaches qui allaitent; si l\\'on forçait leur marche un seul jour, tout le troupeau périrait.\\nQue mon seigneur prenne les devants sur son serviteur; et moi, je suivrai lentement, au pas du troupeau qui me précédera, et au pas des enfants, jusqu\\'à ce que j\\'arrive chez mon seigneur, à Séir.\\nésaü dit: Je veux au moins laisser avec toi une partie de mes gens. Et Jacob répondit: Pourquoi cela? Que je trouve seulement grâce aux yeux de mon seigneur!\\nLe même jour, ésaü reprit le chemin de Séir.\\nJacob partit pour Succoth. Il bâtit une maison pour lui, et il fit des cabanes pour ses troupeaux. C\\'est pourquoi l\\'on a appelé ce lieu de nom de Succoth.\\nA son retour de Paddan Aram, Jacob arriva heureusement à la ville de Sichem, dans le pays de Canaan, et il campa devant la ville.\\nIl acheta la portion du champ où il avait dressé sa tente, des fils d\\'Hamor, père de Sichem, pour cent kesita.\\nEt là, il éleva un autel, qu\\'il appela El élohé Israël.\\nDina, la fille que Léa avait enfantée à Jacob, sortit pour voir les filles du pays.\\nElle fut aperçue de Sichem, fils de Hamor, prince du pays. Il l\\'enleva, coucha avec elle, et la déshonora.\\nSon coeur s\\'attacha à Dina, fille de Jacob; il aima la jeune fille, et sut parler à son coeur.\\nEt Sichem dit à Hamor, son père: Donne-moi cette jeune fille pour femme.\\nJacob apprit qu\\'il avait déshonoré Dina, sa fille; et, comme ses fils étaient aux champs avec son troupeau, Jacob garda le silence jusqu\\'à leur retour.\\nHamor, père de Sichem, se rendit auprès de Jacob pour lui parler.\\nEt les fils de Jacob revenaient des champs, lorsqu\\'ils apprirent la chose; ces hommes furent irrités et se mirent dans une grande colère, parce que Sichem avait commis une infamie en Israël, en couchant avec la fille de Jacob, ce qui n\\'aurait pas dû se faire.\\nHamor leur adressa ainsi la parole: Le coeur de Sichem, mon fils, s\\'est attaché à votre fille; donnez-la-lui pour femme, je vous prie.\\nAlliez-vous avec nous; vous nous donnerez vos filles, et vous prendrez pour vous les nôtres.\\nVous habiterez avec nous, et le pays sera à votre disposition; restez, pour y trafiquer et y acquérir des propriétés.\\nSichem dit au père et aux frères de Dina: Que je trouve grâce à vos yeux, et je donnerai ce que vous me direz.\\nExigez de moi une forte dot et beaucoup de présents, et je donnerai ce que vous me direz; mais accordez-moi pour femme la jeune fille.\\nLes fils de Jacob répondirent et parlèrent avec ruse à Sichem et à Hamor, son père, parce que Sichem avait déshonoré Dina, leur soeur.\\nIls leur dirent: C\\'est une chose que nous ne pouvons pas faire, que de donner notre soeur à un homme incirconcis; car ce serait un opprobre pour nous.\\nNous ne consentirons à votre désir qu\\'à la condition que vous deveniez comme nous, et que tout mâle parmi vous soit circoncis.\\nNous vous donnerons alors nos filles, et nous prendrons pour nous les vôtres; nous habiterons avec vous, et nous formerons un seul peuple.\\nMais si vous ne voulez pas nous écouter et vous faire circoncire, nous prendrons notre fille, et nous nous en irons.\\nLeurs paroles eurent l\\'assentiment de Hamor et de Sichem, fils de Hamor.\\nLe jeune homme ne tarda pas à faire la chose, car il aimait la fille de Jacob. Il était considéré de tous dans la maison de son père.\\nHamor et Sichem, son fils, se rendirent à la porte de leur ville, et ils parlèrent ainsi aux gens de leur ville:\\nCes hommes sont paisibles à notre égard; qu\\'ils restent dans le pays, et qu\\'ils y trafiquent; le pays est assez vaste pour eux. Nous prendrons pour femmes leurs filles, et nous leur donnerons nos filles.\\nMais ces hommes ne consentiront à habiter avec nous, pour former un seul peuple, qu\\'à la condition que tout mâle parmi nous soit circoncis, comme ils sont eux-mêmes circoncis.\\nLeurs troupeaux, leurs biens et tout leur bétail, ne seront-ils pas à nous? Acceptons seulement leur condition, pour qu\\'ils restent avec nous.\\nTous ceux qui étaient venus à la porte de la ville écoutèrent Hamor et Sichem, son fils; et tous les mâles se firent circoncire, tous ceux qui étaient venus à la porte de la ville.\\nLe troisième jour, pendant qu\\'ils étaient souffrants, les deux fils de Jacob, Siméon et Lévi, frères de Dina, prirent chacun leur épée, tombèrent sur la ville qui se croyait en sécurité, et tuèrent tous les mâles.\\nIls passèrent aussi au fil de l\\'épée Hamor et Sichem, son fils; ils enlevèrent Dina de la maison de Sichem, et sortirent.\\nLes fils de Jacob se jetèrent sur les morts, et pillèrent la ville, parce qu\\'on avait déshonoré leur soeur.\\nIls prirent leurs troupeaux, leurs boeufs et leurs ânes, ce qui était dans la ville et ce qui était dans les champs;\\nils emmenèrent comme butin toutes leurs richesses, leurs enfants et leurs femmes, et tout ce qui se trouvait dans les maisons.\\nAlors Jacob dit à Siméon et à Lévi: Vous me troublez, en me rendant odieux aux habitants du pays, aux Cananéens et aux Phérésiens. Je n\\'ai qu\\'un petit nombre d\\'hommes; et ils se rassembleront contre moi, ils me frapperont, et je serai détruit, moi et ma maison.\\nIls répondirent: Traitera-t-on notre soeur comme une prostituée?\\nDieu dit à Jacob: Lève-toi, monte à Béthel, et demeures-y; là, tu dresseras un autel au Dieu qui t\\'apparut, lorsque tu fuyais ésaü, ton frère.\\nJacob dit à sa maison et à tous ceux qui étaient avec lui: Otez les dieux étrangers qui sont au milieu de vous, purifiez-vous, et changez de vêtements.\\nNous nous lèverons, et nous monterons à Béthel; là, je dresserai un autel au Dieu qui m\\'a exaucé dans le jour de ma détresse, et qui a été avec moi pendant le voyage que j\\'ai fait.\\nIls donnèrent à Jacob tous les dieux étrangers qui étaient entre leurs mains, et les anneaux qui étaient à leurs oreilles. Jacob les enfouit sous le térébinthe qui est près de Sichem.\\nEnsuite ils partirent. La terreur de Dieu se répandit sur les villes qui les entouraient, et l\\'on ne poursuivit point les fils de Jacob.\\nJacob arriva, lui et tous ceux qui étaient avec lui, à Luz, qui est Béthel, dans le pays de Canaan.\\nIl bâtit là un autel, et il appela ce lieu El Béthel; car c\\'est là que Dieu s\\'était révélé à lui lorsqu\\'il fuyait son frère.\\nDébora, nourrice de Rebecca, mourut; et elle fut enterrée au-dessous de Béthel, sous le chêne auquel on a donné le nom de chêne des pleurs.\\nDieu apparut encore à Jacob, après son retour de Paddan Aram, et il le bénit.\\nDieu lui dit: Ton nom est Jacob; tu ne seras plus appelé Jacob, mais ton nom sera Israël. Et il lui donna le nom d\\'Israël.\\nDieu lui dit: Je suis le Dieu tout puissant. Sois fécond, et multiplie: une nation et une multitude de nations naîtront de toi, et des rois sortiront de tes reins.\\nJe te donnerai le pays que j\\'ai donné à Abraham et à Isaac, et je donnerai ce pays à ta postérité après toi.\\nDieu s\\'éleva au-dessus de lui, dans le lieu où il lui avait parlé.\\nEt Jacob dressa un monument dans le lieu où Dieu lui avait parlé, un monument de pierres, sur lequel il fit une libation et versa de l\\'huile.\\nJacob donna le nom de Béthel au lieu où Dieu lui avait parlé.\\nIls partirent de Béthel; et il y avait encore une certaine distance jusqu\\'à éphrata, lorsque Rachel accoucha. Elle eut un accouchement pénible;\\net pendant les douleurs de l\\'enfantement, la sage-femme lui dit: Ne crains point, car tu as encore un fils!\\nEt comme elle allait rendre l\\'âme, car elle était mourante, elle lui donna le nom de Ben Oni; mais le père l\\'appela Benjamin.\\nRachel mourut, et elle fut enterrée sur le chemin d\\'éphrata, qui est Bethléhem.\\nJacob éleva un monument sur son sépulcre; c\\'est le monument du sépulcre de Rachel, qui existe encore aujourd\\'hui.\\nIsraël partit; et il dressa sa tente au delà de Migdal éder.\\nPendant qu\\'Israël habitait cette contrée, Ruben alla coucher avec Bilha, concubine de son père. Et Israël l\\'apprit. Les fils de Jacob étaient au nombre de douze.\\nFils de Léa: Ruben, premier-né de Jacob, Siméon, Lévi, Juda, Issacar et Zabulon.\\nFils de Rachel: Joseph et Benjamin.\\nFils de Bilha, servante de Rachel: Dan et Nephthali.\\nFils de Zilpa, servante de Léa: Gad et Aser.

C\\'est là ésaü, père d\\'édom.\\nJacob demeura dans le pays de Canaan, où avait séjourné son père.\\nVoici la postérité de Jacob. Joseph, âgé de dix-sept ans, faisait paître le troupeau avec ses frères; cet enfant était auprès des fils de Bilha et des fils de Zilpa, femmes de son père. Et Joseph rapportait à leur père leurs mauvais propos.\\nIsraël aimait Joseph plus que tous ses autres fils, parce qu\\'il l\\'avait eu dans sa vieillesse; et il lui fit une tunique de plusieurs couleurs.\\nSes frères virent que leur père l\\'aimait plus qu\\'eux tous, et ils le prirent en haine. Ils ne pouvaient lui parler avec amitié.\\nJoseph eut un songe, et il le raconta à ses frères, qui le haïrent encore davantage.\\nIl leur dit: écoutez donc ce songe que j\\'ai eu!\\nNous étions à lier des gerbes au milieu des champs; et voici, ma gerbe se leva et se tint debout, et vos gerbes l\\'entourèrent et se prosternèrent devant elle.\\nSes frères lui dirent: Est-ce que tu régneras sur nous? est-ce que tu nous gouverneras? Et ils le haïrent encore davantage, à cause de ses songes et à cause de ses paroles.\\nIl eut encore un autre songe, et il le raconta à ses frères. Il dit: J\\'ai eu encore un songe! Et voici, le soleil, la lune et onze étoiles se prosternaient devant moi.\\nIl le raconta à son père et à ses frères. Son père le réprimanda, et lui dit: Que signifie ce songe que tu as eu? Faut-il que nous venions, moi, ta mère et tes frères, nous prosterner en terre devant toi?\\nSes frères eurent de l\\'envie contre lui, mais son père garda le souvenir de ces choses.\\nLes frères de Joseph étant allés à Sichem, pour faire paître le troupeau de leur père,\\nIsraël dit à Joseph: Tes frères ne font-ils pas paître le troupeau à Sichem? Viens, je veux t\\'envoyer vers eux. Et il répondit: Me voici!\\nIsraël lui dit: Va, je te prie, et vois si tes frères sont en bonne santé et si le troupeau est en bon état; et tu m\\'en rapporteras des nouvelles. Il l\\'envoya ainsi de la vallée d\\'Hébron; et Joseph alla à Sichem.\\nUn homme le rencontra, comme il errait dans les champs. Il le questionna, en disant: Que cherches-tu?\\nJoseph répondit: Je cherche mes frères; dis-moi, je te prie, où ils font paître leur troupeau.\\nEt l\\'homme dit: Ils sont partis d\\'ici; car je les ai entendus dire: Allons à Dothan. Joseph alla après ses frères, et il les trouva à Dothan.\\nIls le virent de loin; et, avant qu\\'il fût près d\\'eux, ils complotèrent de le faire mourir.\\nIls se dirent l\\'un à l\\'autre: Voici le faiseur de songes qui arrive.\\nVenez maintenant, tuons-le, et jetons-le dans une des citernes; nous dirons qu\\'une bête féroce l\\'a dévoré, et nous verrons ce que deviendront ses songes.\\nRuben entendit cela, et il le délivra de leurs mains. Il dit: Ne lui ôtons pas la vie.\\nRuben leur dit: Ne répandez point de sang; jetez-le dans cette citerne qui est au désert, et ne mettez pas la main sur lui. Il avait dessein de le délivrer de leurs mains pour le faire retourner vers son père.\\nLorsque Joseph fut arrivé auprès de ses frères, ils le dépouillèrent de sa tunique, de la tunique de plusieurs couleurs, qu\\'il avait sur lui.\\nIls le prirent, et le jetèrent dans la citerne. Cette citerne était vide; il n\\'y avait point d\\'eau.\\nIls s\\'assirent ensuite pour manger. Ayant levé les yeux, ils virent une caravane d\\'Ismaélites venant de Galaad; leurs chameaux étaient chargés d\\'aromates, de baume et de myrrhe, qu\\'ils transportaient en égypte.\\nAlors Juda dit à ses frères: Que gagnerons-nous à tuer notre frère et à cacher son sang?\\nVenez, vendons-le aux Ismaélites, et ne mettons pas la main sur lui, car il est notre frère, notre chair. Et ses frères l\\'écoutèrent.\\nAu passage des marchands madianites, ils tirèrent et firent remonter Joseph hors de la citerne; et ils le vendirent pour vingt sicles d\\'argent aux Ismaélites, qui l\\'emmenèrent en égypte.\\nRuben revint à la citerne; et voici, Joseph n\\'était plus dans la citerne. Il déchira ses vêtements,\\nretourna vers ses frères, et dit: L\\'enfant n\\'y est plus! Et moi, où irai-je?\\nIls prirent alors la tunique de Joseph; et, ayant tué un bouc, ils plongèrent la tunique dans le sang.\\nIls envoyèrent à leur père la tunique de plusieurs couleurs, en lui faisant dire: Voici ce que nous avons trouvé! reconnais si c\\'est la tunique de ton fils, ou non.\\nJacob la reconnut, et dit: C\\'est la tunique de mon fils! une bête féroce l\\'a dévoré! Joseph a été mis en pièces!\\nEt il déchira ses vêtements, il mit un sac sur ses reins, et il porta longtemps le deuil de son fils.\\nTous ses fils et toutes ses filles vinrent pour le consoler; mais il ne voulut recevoir aucune consolation. Il disait: C\\'est en pleurant que je descendrai vers mon fils au séjour des morts! Et il pleurait son fils.\\nLes Madianites le vendirent en égypte à Potiphar, officier de Pharaon, chef des gardes.\\nEn ce temps-là, Juda s\\'éloigna de ses frères, et se retira vers un homme d\\'Adullam, nommé Hira.\\nLà, Juda vit la fille d\\'un Cananéen, nommé Schua; il la prit pour femme, et alla vers elle.\\nElle devint enceinte, et enfanta un fils, qu\\'elle appela Er.\\nElle devint encore enceinte, et enfanta un fils, qu\\'elle appela Onan.\\nElle enfanta de nouveau un fils, qu\\'elle appela Schéla; Juda était à Czib quand elle l\\'enfanta.\\nJuda prit pour Er, son premier-né, une femme nommée Tamar.\\nEr, premier-né de Juda, était méchant aux yeux de l\\'éternel; et l\\'éternel le fit mourir.\\nAlors Juda dit à Onan: Va vers la femme de ton frère, prends-la, comme beau-frère, et suscite une postérité à ton frère.\\nOnan, sachant que cette postérité ne serait pas à lui, se souillait à terre lorsqu\\'il allait vers la femme de son frère, afin de ne pas donner de postérité à son frère.\\nCe qu\\'il faisait déplut à l\\'éternel, qui le fit aussi mourir.\\nAlors Juda dit à Tamar, sa belle-fille: Demeure veuve dans la maison de ton père, jusqu\\'à ce que Schéla, mon fils, soit grand. Il parlait ainsi dans la crainte que Schéla ne mourût comme ses frères. Tamar s\\'en alla, et elle habita dans la maison de son père.\\nLes jours s\\'écoulèrent, et la fille de Schua, femme de Juda, mourut. Lorsque Juda fut consolé, il monta à Thimna, vers ceux qui tondaient ses brebis, lui et son ami Hira, l\\'Adullamite.\\nOn en informa Tamar, et on lui dit: Voici ton beau-père qui monte à Thimna, pour tondre ses brebis.\\nAlors elle ôta ses habits de veuve, elle se couvrit d\\'un voile et s\\'enveloppa, et elle s\\'assit à l\\'entrée d\\'énaïm, sur le chemin de Thimna; car elle voyait que Schéla était devenu grand, et qu\\'elle ne lui était point donnée pour femme.\\nJuda la vit, et la prit pour une prostituée, parce qu\\'elle avait couvert son visage.\\nIl l\\'aborda sur le chemin, et dit: Laisse-moi aller vers toi. Car il ne connut pas que c\\'était sa belle-fille. Elle dit: Que me donneras-tu pour venir vers moi?\\nIl répondit: Je t\\'enverrai un chevreau de mon troupeau. Elle dit: Me donneras-tu un gage, jusqu\\'à ce que tu l\\'envoies?\\nIl répondit: Quel gage te donnerai-je? Elle dit: Ton cachet, ton cordon, et le bâton que tu as à la main. Il les lui donna. Puis il alla vers elle; et elle devint enceinte de lui.\\nElle se leva, et s\\'en alla; elle ôta son voile, et remit ses habits de veuve.\\nJuda envoya le chevreau par son ami l\\'Adullamite, pour retirer le gage des mains de la femme. Mais il ne la trouva point.\\nIl interrogea les gens du lieu, en disant: Où est cette prostituée qui se tenait à énaïm, sur le chemin? Ils répondirent: Il n\\'y a point eu ici de prostituée.\\nIl retourna auprès de Juda, et dit: Je ne l\\'ai pas trouvée, et même les gens du lieu ont dit: Il n\\'y a point eu ici de prostituée.\\nJuda dit: Qu\\'elle garde ce qu\\'elle a! Ne nous exposons pas au mépris. Voici, j\\'ai envoyé ce chevreau, et tu ne l\\'as pas trouvée.\\nEnviron trois mois après, on vint dire à Juda: Tamar, ta belle-fille, s\\'est prostituée, et même la voilà enceinte à la suite de sa prostitution. Et Juda dit: Faites-la sortir, et qu\\'elle soit brûlée.\\nComme on l\\'amenait dehors, elle fit dire à son beau-père: C\\'est de l\\'homme à qui ces choses appartiennent que je suis enceinte; reconnais, je te prie, à qui sont ce cachet, ces cordons et ce bâton.\\nJuda les reconnut, et dit: Elle est moins coupable que moi, puisque je ne l\\'ai pas donnée à Schéla, mon fils. Et il ne la connut plus.\\nQuand elle fut au moment d\\'accoucher, voici, il y avait deux jumeaux dans son ventre.\\nEt pendant l\\'accouchement il y en eut un qui présenta la main; la sage-femme la prit, et y attacha un fil cramoisi, en disant: Celui-ci sort le premier.\\nMais il retira la main, et son frère sortit. Alors la sage-femme dit: Quelle brèche tu as faite! Et elle lui donna le nom de Pérets.\\nEnsuite sortit son frère, qui avait à la main le fil cramoisi; et on lui donna le nom de Zérach.\\nOn fit descendre Joseph en égypte; et Potiphar, officier de Pharaon, chef des gardes, égyptien, l\\'acheta des Ismaélites qui l\\'y avaient fait descendre.\\nL\\'éternel fut avec lui, et la prospérité l\\'accompagna; il habitait dans la maison de son maître, l\\'égyptien.\\nSon maître vit que l\\'éternel était avec lui, et que l\\'éternel faisait prospérer entre ses mains tout ce qu\\'il entreprenait.\\nJoseph trouva grâce aux yeux de son maître, qui l\\'employa à son service, l\\'établit sur sa maison, et lui confia tout ce qu\\'il possédait.\\nDès que Potiphar l\\'eut établi sur sa maison et sur tout ce qu\\'il possédait, l\\'éternel bénit la maison de l\\'égyptien, à cause de Joseph; et la bénédiction de l\\'éternel fut sur tout ce qui lui appartenait, soit à la maison, soit aux champs.\\nIl abandonna aux mains de Joseph tout ce qui lui appartenait, et il n\\'avait avec lui d\\'autre soin que celui de prendre sa nourriture. Or, Joseph était beau de taille et beau de figure.\\nAprès ces choses, il arriva que la femme de son maître porta les yeux sur Joseph, et dit: Couche avec moi!\\nIl refusa, et dit à la femme de son maître: Voici, mon maître ne prend avec moi connaissance de rien dans la maison, et il a remis entre mes mains tout ce qui lui appartient.\\nIl n\\'est pas plus grand que moi dans cette maison, et il ne m\\'a rien interdit, excepté toi, parce que tu es sa femme. Comment ferais-je un aussi grand mal et pécherais-je contre Dieu?\\nQuoiqu\\'elle parlât tous les jours à Joseph, il refusa de coucher auprès d\\'elle, d\\'être avec elle.\\nUn jour qu\\'il était entré dans la maison pour faire son ouvrage, et qu\\'il n\\'y avait là aucun des gens de la maison,\\nelle le saisit par son vêtement, en disant: Couche avec moi! Il lui laissa son vêtement dans la main, et s\\'enfuit au dehors.\\nLorsqu\\'elle vit qu\\'il lui avait laissé son vêtement dans la main, et qu\\'il s\\'était enfui dehors,\\nelle appela les gens de sa maison, et leur dit: Voyez, il nous a amené un Hébreu pour se jouer de nous. Cet homme est venu vers moi pour coucher avec moi; mais j\\'ai crié à haute voix.\\nEt quand il a entendu que j\\'élevais la voix et que je criais, il a laissé son vêtement à côté de moi et s\\'est enfui dehors.\\nEt elle posa le vêtement de Joseph à côté d\\'elle, jusqu\\'à ce que son maître rentrât à la maison.\\nAlors elle lui parla ainsi: L\\'esclave hébreu que tu nous as amené est venu vers moi pour se jouer de moi.\\nEt comme j\\'ai élevé la voix et que j\\'ai crié, il a laissé son vêtement à côté de moi et s\\'est enfui dehors.\\nAprès avoir entendu les paroles de sa femme, qui lui disait: Voilà ce que m\\'a fait ton esclave! le maître de Joseph fut enflammé de colère.\\nIl prit Joseph, et le mit dans la prison, dans le lieu où les prisonniers du roi étaient enfermés: il fut là, en prison.\\nL\\'éternel fut avec Joseph, et il étendit sur lui sa bonté. Il le mit en faveur aux yeux du chef de la prison.\\nEt le chef de la prison plaça sous sa surveillance tous les prisonniers qui étaient dans la prison; et rien ne s\\'y faisait que par lui.\\nLe chef de la prison ne prenait aucune connaissance de ce que Joseph avait en main, parce que l\\'éternel était avec lui. Et l\\'éternel donnait de la réussite à ce qu\\'il faisait.\\nAprès ces choses, il arriva que l\\'échanson et le panetier du roi d\\'égypte, offensèrent leur maître, le roi d\\'égypte.\\nPharaon fut irrité contre ses deux officiers, le chef des échansons et le chef des panetiers.\\nEt il les fit mettre dans la maison du chef des gardes, dans la prison, dans le lieu où Joseph était enfermé.\\nLe chef des gardes les plaça sous la surveillance de Joseph, qui faisait le service auprès d\\'eux; et ils passèrent un certain temps en prison.\\nPendant une même nuit, l\\'échanson et le panetier du roi d\\'égypte, qui étaient enfermés dans la prison, eurent tous les deux un songe, chacun le sien, pouvant recevoir une explication distincte.\\nJoseph, étant venu le matin vers eux, les regarda; et voici, ils étaient tristes.\\nAlors il questionna les officiers de Pharaon, qui étaient avec lui dans la prison de son maître, et il leur dit: Pourquoi avez-vous mauvais visage aujourd\\'hui?\\nIls lui répondirent: Nous avons eu un songe, et il n\\'y a personne pour l\\'expliquer. Joseph leur dit: N\\'est-ce pas à Dieu qu\\'appartiennent les explications? Racontez-moi donc votre songe.\\nLe chef des échansons raconta son songe à Joseph, et lui dit: Dans mon songe, voici, il y avait un cep devant moi.\\nCe cep avait trois sarments. Quand il eut poussé, sa fleur se développa et ses grappes donnèrent des raisins mûrs.\\nLa coupe de Pharaon était dans ma main. Je pris les raisins, je les pressai dans la coupe de Pharaon, et je mis la coupe dans la main de Pharaon.\\nJoseph lui dit: En voici l\\'explication. Les trois sarments sont trois jours.\\nEncore trois jours, et Pharaon relèvera ta tête et te rétablira dans ta charge; tu mettras la coupe dans la main de Pharaon, comme tu en avais l\\'habitude lorsque tu étais son échanson.\\nMais souviens-toi de moi, quand tu seras heureux, et montre, je te prie, de la bonté à mon égard; parle en ma faveur à Pharaon, et fais-moi sortir de cette maison.\\nCar j\\'ai été enlevé du pays des Hébreux, et ici même je n\\'ai rien fait pour être mis en prison.\\nLe chef des panetiers, voyant que Joseph avait donné une explication favorable, dit: Voici, il y avait aussi, dans mon songe, trois corbeilles de pain blanc sur ma tête.\\nDans la corbeille la plus élevée il y avait pour Pharaon des mets de toute espèce, cuits au four; et les oiseaux les mangeaient dans la corbeille au-dessus de ma tête.\\nJoseph répondit, et dit: En voici l\\'explication. Les trois corbeilles sont trois jours.\\nEncore trois jours, et Pharaon enlèvera ta tête de dessus toi, te fera pendre à un bois, et les oiseaux mangeront ta chair.\\nLe troisième jour, jour de la naissance de Pharaon, il fit un festin à tous ses serviteurs; et il éleva la tête du chef des échansons et la tête du chef des panetiers, au milieu de ses serviteurs:\\nil rétablit le chef des échansons dans sa charge d\\'échanson, pour qu\\'il mît la coupe dans la main de Pharaon;\\nmais il fit pendre le chef des panetiers, selon l\\'explication que Joseph leur avait donnée.\\nLe chef des échansons ne pensa plus à Joseph. Il l\\'oublia.\\nAu bout de deux ans, Pharaon eut un songe. Voici, il se tenait près du fleuve.\\nEt voici, sept vaches belles à voir et grasses de chair montèrent hors du fleuve, et se mirent à paître dans la prairie.\\nSept autres vaches laides à voir et maigres de chair montèrent derrière elles hors du fleuve, et se tinrent à leurs côtés sur le bord du fleuve.\\nLes vaches laides à voir et maigres de chair mangèrent les sept vaches belles à voir et grasses de chair. Et Pharaon s\\'éveilla.\\nIl se rendormit, et il eut un second songe. Voici, sept épis gras et beaux montèrent sur une même tige.\\nEt sept épis maigres et brûlés par le vent d\\'orient poussèrent après eux.\\nLes épis maigres engloutirent les sept épis gras et pleins. Et Pharaon s\\'éveilla. Voilà le songe.\\nLe matin, Pharaon eut l\\'esprit agité, et il fit appeler tous les magiciens et tous les sages de l\\'égypte. Il leur raconta ses songes. Mais personne ne put les expliquer à Pharaon.\\nAlors le chef des échansons prit la parole, et dit à Pharaon: Je vais rappeler aujourd\\'hui le souvenir de ma faute.\\nPharaon s\\'était irrité contre ses serviteurs; et il m\\'avait fait mettre en prison dans la maison du chef des gardes, moi et le chef des panetiers.\\nNous eûmes l\\'un et l\\'autre un songe dans une même nuit; et chacun de nous reçut une explication en rapport avec le songe qu\\'il avait eu.\\nIl y avait là avec nous un jeune Hébreu, esclave du chef des gardes. Nous lui racontâmes nos songes, et il nous les expliqua.\\nLes choses sont arrivées selon l\\'explication qu\\'il nous avait donnée. Pharaon me rétablit dans ma charge, et il fit pendre le chef des panetiers.\\nPharaon fit appeler Joseph. On le fit sortir en hâte de prison. Il se rasa, changea de vêtements, et se rendit vers Pharaon.\\nPharaon dit à Joseph: J\\'ai eu un songe. Personne ne peut l\\'expliquer; et j\\'ai appris que tu expliques un songe, après l\\'avoir entendu.\\nJoseph répondit à Pharaon, en disant: Ce n\\'est pas moi! c\\'est Dieu qui donnera une réponse favorable à Pharaon.\\nPharaon dit alors à Joseph: Dans mon songe, voici, je me tenais sur le bord du fleuve.\\nEt voici, sept vaches grasses de chair et belles d\\'apparence montèrent hors du fleuve, et se mirent à paître dans la prairie.\\nSept autres vaches montèrent derrière elles, maigres, fort laides d\\'apparence, et décharnées: je n\\'en ai point vu d\\'aussi laides dans tout le pays d\\'égypte.\\nLes vaches décharnées et laides mangèrent les sept premières vaches qui étaient grasses.\\nElles les engloutirent dans leur ventre, sans qu\\'on s\\'aperçût qu\\'elles y fussent entrées; et leur apparence était laide comme auparavant. Et je m\\'éveillai.\\nJe vis encore en songe sept épis pleins et beaux, qui montèrent sur une même tige.\\nEt sept épis vides, maigres, brûlés par le vent d\\'orient, poussèrent après eux.\\nLes épis maigres engloutirent les sept beaux épis. Je l\\'ai dit aux magiciens, mais personne ne m\\'a donné l\\'explication.\\nJoseph dit à Pharaon: Ce qu\\'a songé Pharaon est une seule chose; Dieu a fait connaître à Pharaon ce qu\\'il va faire.\\nLes sept vaches belles sont sept années: et les sept épis beaux sont sept années: c\\'est un seul songe.\\nLes sept vaches décharnées et laides, qui montaient derrière les premières, sont sept années; et les sept épis vides, brûlés par le vent d\\'orient, seront sept années de famine.\\nAinsi, comme je viens de le dire à Pharaon, Dieu a fait connaître à Pharaon ce qu\\'il va faire.\\nVoici, il y aura sept années de grande abondance dans tout le pays d\\'égypte.\\nSept années de famine viendront après elles; et l\\'on oubliera toute cette abondance au pays d\\'égypte, et la famine consumera le pays.\\nCette famine qui suivra sera si forte qu\\'on ne s\\'apercevra plus de l\\'abondance dans le pays.\\nSi Pharaon a vu le songe se répéter une seconde fois, c\\'est que la chose est arrêtée de la part de Dieu, et que Dieu se hâtera de l\\'exécuter.\\nMaintenant, que Pharaon choisisse un homme intelligent et sage, et qu\\'il le mette à la tête du pays d\\'égypte.\\nQue Pharaon établisse des commissaires sur le pays, pour lever un cinquième des récoltes de l\\'égypte pendant les sept années d\\'abondance.\\nQu\\'ils rassemblent tous les produits de ces bonnes années qui vont venir; qu\\'ils fassent, sous l\\'autorité de Pharaon, des amas de blé, des approvisionnements dans les villes, et qu\\'ils en aient la garde.\\nCes provisions seront en réserve pour le pays, pour les sept années de famine qui arriveront dans le pays d\\'égypte, afin que le pays ne soit pas consumé par la famine.\\nCes paroles plurent à Pharaon et à tous ses serviteurs.\\nEt Pharaon dit à ses serviteurs: Trouverions-nous un homme comme celui-ci, ayant en lui l\\'esprit de Dieu?\\nEt Pharaon dit à Joseph: Puisque Dieu t\\'a fait connaître toutes ces choses, il n\\'y a personne qui soit aussi intelligent et aussi sage que toi.\\nJe t\\'établis sur ma maison, et tout mon peuple obéira à tes ordres. Le trône seul m\\'élèvera au-dessus de toi.\\nPharaon dit à Joseph: Vois, je te donne le commandement de tout le pays d\\'égypte.\\nPharaon ôta son anneau de la main, et le mit à la main de Joseph; il le revêtit d\\'habits de fin lin, et lui mit un collier d\\'or au cou.\\nIl le fit monter sur le char qui suivait le sien; et l\\'on criait devant lui: A genoux! C\\'est ainsi que Pharaon lui donna le commandement de tout le pays d\\'égypte.\\nIl dit encore à Joseph: Je suis Pharaon! Et sans toi personne ne lèvera la main ni le pied dans tout le pays d\\'égypte.\\nPharaon appela Joseph du nom de Tsaphnath Paenéach; et il lui donna pour femme Asnath, fille de Poti Phéra, prêtre d\\'On. Et Joseph partit pour visiter le pays d\\'égypte.\\nJoseph était âgé de trente ans lorsqu\\'il se présenta devant Pharaon, roi d\\'égypte; et il quitta Pharaon, et parcourut tout le pays d\\'égypte.\\nPendant les sept années de fertilité, la terre rapporta abondamment.\\nJoseph rassembla tous les produits de ces sept années dans le pays d\\'égypte; il fit des approvisionnements dans les villes, mettant dans l\\'intérieur de chaque ville les productions des champs d\\'alentour.\\nJoseph amassa du blé, comme le sable de la mer, en quantité si considérable que l\\'on cessa de compter, parce qu\\'il n\\'y avait plus de nombre.\\nAvant les années de famine, il naquit à Joseph deux fils, que lui enfanta Asnath, fille de Poti Phéra, prêtre d\\'On.\\nJoseph donna au premier-né le nom de Manassé, car, dit-il, Dieu m\\'a fait oublier toutes mes peines et toute la maison de mon père.\\nEt il donna au second le nom d\\'éphraïm, car, dit-il, Dieu m\\'a rendu fécond dans le pays de mon affliction.\\nLes sept années d\\'abondance qu\\'il y eut au pays d\\'égypte s\\'écoulèrent.\\nEt les sept années de famine commencèrent à venir, ainsi que Joseph l\\'avait annoncé. Il y eut famine dans tous les pays; mais dans tout le pays d\\'égypte il y avait du pain.\\nQuand tout le pays d\\'égypte fut aussi affamé, le peuple cria à Pharaon pour avoir du pain. Pharaon dit à tous les égyptiens: Allez vers Joseph, et faites ce qu\\'il vous dira.\\nLa famine régnait dans tout le pays. Joseph ouvrit tous les lieux d\\'approvisionnement, et vendit du blé aux égyptiens. La famine augmentait dans le pays d\\'égypte.\\nEt de tous les pays on arrivait en égypte, pour acheter du blé auprès de Joseph; car la famine était forte dans tous les pays.\\nJacob, voyant qu\\'il y avait du blé en égypte, dit à ses fils: Pourquoi vous regardez-vous les uns les autres?\\nIl dit: Voici, j\\'apprends qu\\'il y a du blé en égypte; descendez-y, pour nous en acheter là, afin que nous vivions et que nous ne mourions pas.\\nDix frères de Joseph descendirent en égypte, pour acheter du blé.\\nJacob n\\'envoya point avec eux Benjamin, frère de Joseph, dans la crainte qu\\'il ne lui arrivât quelque malheur.\\nLes fils d\\'Israël vinrent pour acheter du blé, au milieu de ceux qui venaient aussi; car la famine était dans le pays de Canaan.\\nJoseph commandait dans le pays; c\\'est lui qui vendait du blé à tout le peuple du pays. Les frères de Joseph vinrent, et se prosternèrent devant lui la face contre terre.\\nJoseph vit ses frères et les reconnut; mais il feignit d\\'être un étranger pour eux, il leur parla durement, et leur dit: D\\'où venez-vous? Ils répondirent: Du pays de Canaan, pour acheter des vivres.\\nJoseph reconnut ses frères, mais eux ne le reconnurent pas.\\nJoseph se souvint des songes qu\\'il avait eus à leur sujet, et il leur dit: Vous êtes des espions; c\\'est pour observer les lieux faibles du pays que vous êtes venus.\\nIls lui répondirent: Non, mon seigneur, tes serviteurs sont venus pour acheter du blé.\\nNous sommes tous fils d\\'un même homme; nous sommes sincères, tes serviteurs ne sont pas des espions.\\nIl leur dit: Nullement; c\\'est pour observer les lieux faibles du pays que vous êtes venus.\\nIls répondirent: Nous, tes serviteurs, sommes douze frères, fils d\\'un même homme au pays de Canaan; et voici, le plus jeune est aujourd\\'hui avec notre père, et il y en a un qui n\\'est plus.\\nJoseph leur dit: Je viens de vous le dire, vous êtes des espions.\\nVoici comment vous serez éprouvés. Par la vie de Pharaon! vous ne sortirez point d\\'ici que votre jeune frère ne soit venu.\\nEnvoyez l\\'un de vous pour chercher votre frère; et vous, restez prisonniers. Vos paroles seront éprouvées, et je saurai si la vérité est chez vous; sinon, par la vie de Pharaon! vous êtes des espions.\\nEt il les mit ensemble trois jours en prison.\\nLe troisième jour, Joseph leur dit: Faites ceci, et vous vivrez. Je crains Dieu!\\nSi vous êtes sincères, que l\\'un de vos frères reste enfermé dans votre prison; et vous, partez, emportez du blé pour nourrir vos familles,\\net amenez-moi votre jeune frère, afin que vos paroles soient éprouvées et que vous ne mouriez point. Et ils firent ainsi.\\nIls se dirent alors l\\'un à l\\'autre: Oui, nous avons été coupables envers notre frère, car nous avons vu l\\'angoisse de son âme, quand il nous demandait grâce, et nous ne l\\'avons point écouté! C\\'est pour cela que cette affliction nous arrive.\\nRuben, prenant la parole, leur dit: Ne vous disais-je pas: Ne commettez point un crime envers cet enfant? Mais vous n\\'avez point écouté. Et voici, son sang est redemandé.\\nIls ne savaient pas que Joseph comprenait, car il se servait avec eux d\\'un interprète.\\nIl s\\'éloigna d\\'eux, pour pleurer. Il revint, et leur parla; puis il prit parmi eux Siméon, et le fit enchaîner sous leurs yeux.\\nJoseph ordonna qu\\'on remplît de blé leurs sacs, qu\\'on remît l\\'argent de chacun dans son sac, et qu\\'on leur donnât des provisions pour la route. Et l\\'on fit ainsi.\\nIls chargèrent le blé sur leurs ânes, et partirent.\\nL\\'un d\\'eux ouvrit son sac pour donner du fourrage à son âne, dans le lieu où ils passèrent la nuit, et il vit l\\'argent qui était à l\\'entrée du sac.\\nIl dit à ses frères: Mon argent a été rendu, et le voici dans mon sac. Alors leur coeur fut en défaillance; et ils se dirent l\\'un à l\\'autre, en tremblant: Qu\\'est-ce que Dieu nous a fait?\\nIls revinrent auprès de Jacob, leur père, dans le pays de Canaan, et ils lui racontèrent tout ce qui leur était arrivé. Ils dirent:\\nL\\'homme, qui est le seigneur du pays, nous a parlé durement, et il nous a pris pour des espions.\\nNous lui avons dit: Nous sommes sincères, nous ne sommes pas des espions.\\nNous sommes douze frères, fils de notre père; l\\'un n\\'est plus, et le plus jeune est aujourd\\'hui avec notre père au pays de Canaan.\\nEt l\\'homme, qui est le seigneur du pays, nous a dit: Voici comment je saurai si vous êtes sincères. Laissez auprès de moi l\\'un de vos frères, prenez de quoi nourrir vos familles, partez, et amenez-moi votre jeune frère.\\nJe saurai ainsi que vous n\\'êtes pas des espions, que vous êtes sincères; je vous rendrai votre frère, et vous pourrez librement parcourir le pays.\\nLorsqu\\'ils vidèrent leurs sacs, voici, le paquet d\\'argent de chacun était dans son sac. Ils virent, eux et leur père, leurs paquets d\\'argent, et ils eurent peur.\\nJacob, leur père, leur dit: Vous me privez de mes enfants! Joseph n\\'est plus, Siméon n\\'est plus, et vous prendriez Benjamin! C\\'est sur moi que tout cela retombe.\\nRuben dit à son père: Tu feras mourir mes deux fils si je ne te ramène pas Benjamin; remets-le entre mes mains, et je te le ramènerai.\\nJacob dit: Mon fils ne descendra point avec vous; car son frère est mort, et il reste seul; s\\'il lui arrivait un malheur dans le voyage que vous allez faire, vous feriez descendre mes cheveux blancs avec douleur dans le séjour des morts.\\nLa famine s\\'appesantissait sur le pays.\\nQuand ils eurent fini de manger le blé qu\\'ils avaient apporté d\\'égypte, Jacob dit à ses fils: Retournez, achetez-nous un peu de vivres.\\nJuda lui répondit: Cet homme nous a fait cette déclaration formelle: Vous ne verrez pas ma face, à moins que votre frère ne soit avec vous.\\nSi donc tu veux envoyer notre frère avec nous, nous descendrons, et nous t\\'achèterons des vivres.\\nMais si tu ne veux pas l\\'envoyer, nous ne descendrons point, car cet homme nous a dit: Vous ne verrez pas ma face, à moins que votre frère ne soit avec vous.\\nIsraël dit alors: Pourquoi avez-vous mal agi à mon égard, en disant à cet homme que vous aviez encore un frère?\\nIls répondirent: Cet homme nous a interrogés sur nous et sur notre famille, en disant: Votre père vit-il encore? avez-vous un frère? Et nous avons répondu à ces questions. Pouvions-nous savoir qu\\'il dirait: Faites descendre votre frère?\\nJuda dit à Israël, son père: Laisse venir l\\'enfant avec moi, afin que nous nous levions et que nous partions; et nous vivrons et ne mourrons pas, nous, toi, et nos enfants.\\nJe réponds de lui; tu le redemanderas de ma main. Si je ne le ramène pas auprès de toi et si je ne le remets pas devant ta face, je serai pour toujours coupable envers toi.\\nCar si nous n\\'eussions pas tardé, nous serions maintenant deux fois de retour.\\nIsraël, leur père, leur dit: Puisqu\\'il le faut, faites ceci. Prenez dans vos sacs des meilleures productions du pays, pour en porter un présent à cet homme, un peu de baume et un peu de miel, des aromates, de la myrrhe, des pistaches et des amandes.\\nPrenez avec vous de l\\'argent au double, et remportez l\\'argent qu\\'on avait mis à l\\'entrée de vos sacs: peut-être était-ce une erreur.\\nPrenez votre frère, et levez-vous; retournez vers cet homme.\\nQue le Dieu tout puissant vous fasse trouver grâce devant cet homme, et qu\\'il laisse revenir avec vous votre autre frère et Benjamin! Et moi, si je dois être privé de mes enfants, que j\\'en sois privé!\\nIls prirent le présent; ils prirent avec eux de l\\'argent au double, ainsi que Benjamin; ils se levèrent, descendirent en égypte, et se présentèrent devant Joseph.\\nDès que Joseph vit avec eux Benjamin, il dit à son intendant: Fais entrer ces gens dans la maison, tue et apprête; car ces gens mangeront avec moi à midi.\\nCet homme fit ce que Joseph avait ordonné, et il conduisit ces gens dans la maison de Joseph.\\nIls eurent peur lorsqu\\'ils furent conduits à la maison de Joseph, et ils dirent: C\\'est à cause de l\\'argent remis l\\'autre fois dans nos sacs qu\\'on nous emmène; c\\'est pour se jeter sur nous, se précipiter sur nous; c\\'est pour nous prendre comme esclaves, et s\\'emparer de nos ânes.\\nIls s\\'approchèrent de l\\'intendant de la maison de Joseph, et lui adressèrent la parole, à l\\'entrée de la maison.\\nIls dirent: Pardon! mon seigneur, nous sommes déjà descendus une fois pour acheter des vivres.\\nPuis, quand nous arrivâmes, au lieu où nous devions passer la nuit, nous avons ouvert nos sacs; et voici, l\\'argent de chacun était à l\\'entrée de son sac, notre argent selon son poids: nous le rapportons avec nous.\\nNous avons aussi apporté d\\'autre argent, pour acheter des vivres. Nous ne savons pas qui avait mis notre argent dans nos sacs.\\nL\\'intendant répondit: Que la paix soit avec vous! Ne craignez rien. C\\'est votre Dieu, le Dieu de votre père, qui vous a donné un trésor dans vos sacs. Votre argent m\\'est parvenu. Et il leur amena Siméon.\\nCet homme les fit entrer dans la maison de Joseph; il leur donna de l\\'eau et ils se lavèrent les pieds; il donna aussi du fourrage à leurs ânes.\\nIls préparèrent leur présent, en attendant que Joseph vienne à midi; car on les avait informés qu\\'ils mangeraient chez lui.\\nQuand Joseph fut arrivé à la maison, ils lui offrirent le présent qu\\'ils avaient apporté, et ils se prosternèrent en terre devant lui.\\nIl leur demanda comment ils se portaient; et il dit: Votre vieux père, dont vous avez parlé, est-il en bonne santé? vit-il encore?\\nIls répondirent: Ton serviteur, notre père, est en bonne santé; il vit encore. Et ils s\\'inclinèrent et se prosternèrent.\\nJoseph leva les yeux; et, jetant un regard sur Benjamin, son frère, fils de sa mère, il dit: Est-ce là votre jeune frère, dont vous m\\'avez parlé? Et il ajouta: Dieu te fasse miséricorde, mon fils!\\nSes entrailles étaient émues pour son frère, et il avait besoin de pleurer; il entra précipitamment dans une chambre, et il y pleura.\\nAprès s\\'être lavé le visage, il en sortit; et, faisant des efforts pour se contenir, il dit: Servez à manger.\\nOn servit Joseph à part, et ses frères à part; les égyptiens qui mangeaient avec lui furent aussi servis à part, car les égyptiens ne pouvaient pas manger avec les Hébreux, parce que c\\'est à leurs yeux une abomination.\\nLes frères de Joseph s\\'assirent en sa présence, le premier-né selon son droit d\\'aînesse, et le plus jeune selon son âge; et ils se regardaient les uns les autres avec étonnement.\\nJoseph leur fit porter des mets qui étaient devant lui, et Benjamin en eut cinq fois plus que les autres. Ils burent, et s\\'égayèrent avec lui.\\nJoseph donna cet ordre à l\\'intendant de sa maison: Remplis de vivres les sacs de ces gens, autant qu\\'ils en pourront porter, et mets l\\'argent de chacun à l\\'entrée de son sac.\\nTu mettras aussi ma coupe, la coupe d\\'argent, à l\\'entrée du sac du plus jeune, avec l\\'argent de son blé. L\\'intendant fit ce que Joseph lui avait ordonné.\\nLe matin, dès qu\\'il fit jour, on renvoya ces gens avec leur ânes.\\nIls étaient sortis de la ville, et ils n\\'en étaient guère éloignés, lorsque Joseph dit à son intendant: Lève-toi, poursuis ces gens; et, quand tu les auras atteints, tu leur diras: Pourquoi avez-vous rendu le mal pour le bien?\\nN\\'avez-vous pas la coupe dans laquelle boit mon seigneur, et dont il se sert pour deviner? Vous avez mal fait d\\'agir ainsi.\\nL\\'intendant les atteignit, et leur dit ces mêmes paroles.\\nIls lui répondirent: Pourquoi mon seigneur parle-t-il de la sorte? Dieu préserve tes serviteurs d\\'avoir commis une telle action!\\nVoici, nous t\\'avons rapporté du pays de Canaan l\\'argent que nous avons trouvé à l\\'entrée de nos sacs; comment aurions-nous dérobé de l\\'argent ou de l\\'or dans la maison de ton seigneur?\\nQue celui de tes serviteurs sur qui se trouvera la coupe meure, et que nous soyons nous-mêmes esclaves de mon seigneur!\\nIl dit: Qu\\'il en soit donc selon vos paroles! Celui sur qui se trouvera la coupe sera mon esclave; et vous, vous serez innocents.\\nAussitôt, chacun descendit son sac à terre, et chacun ouvrit son sac.\\nL\\'intendant les fouilla, commençant par le plus âgé et finissant par le plus jeune; et la coupe fut trouvée dans le sac de Benjamin.\\nIls déchirèrent leurs vêtements, chacun rechargea son âne, et ils retournèrent à la ville.\\nJuda et ses frères arrivèrent à la maison de Joseph, où il était encore, et ils se prosternèrent en terre devant lui.\\nJoseph leur dit: Quelle action avez-vous faite? Ne savez-vous pas qu\\'un homme comme moi a le pouvoir de deviner?\\nJuda répondit: Que dirons-nous à mon seigneur? comment parlerons-nous? comment nous justifierons-nous? Dieu a trouvé l\\'iniquité de tes serviteurs. Nous voici esclaves de mon seigneur, nous, et celui sur qui s\\'est trouvée la coupe.\\nEt Joseph dit: Dieu me garde de faire cela! L\\'homme sur qui la coupe a été trouvée sera mon esclave; mais vous, remontez en paix vers votre père.\\nAlors Juda s\\'approcha de Joseph, et dit: De grâce, mon seigneur, que ton serviteur puisse faire entendre une parole à mon seigneur, et que sa colère ne s\\'enflamme point contre ton serviteur! car tu es comme Pharaon.\\nMon seigneur a interrogé ses serviteurs, en disant: Avez-vous un père, ou un frère?\\nNous avons répondu: Nous avons un vieux père, et un jeune frère, enfant de sa vieillesse; cet enfant avait un frère qui est mort, et qui était de la même mère; il reste seul, et son père l\\'aime.\\nTu as dit à tes serviteurs: Faites-le descendre vers moi, et que je le voie de mes propres yeux.\\nNous avons répondu à mon seigneur: L\\'enfant ne peut pas quitter son père; s\\'il le quitte, son père mourra.\\nTu as dit à tes serviteurs: Si votre jeune frère ne descend pas avec vous, vous ne reverrez pas ma face.\\nLorsque nous sommes remontés auprès de ton serviteur, mon père, nous lui avons rapporté les paroles de mon seigneur.\\nNotre père a dit: Retournez, achetez-nous un peu de vivres.\\nNous avons répondu: Nous ne pouvons pas descendre; mais, si notre jeune frère est avec nous, nous descendrons, car nous ne pouvons pas voir la face de cet homme, à moins que notre jeune frère ne soit avec nous.\\nTon serviteur, notre père, nous a dit: Vous savez que ma femme m\\'a enfanté deux fils.\\nL\\'un étant sorti de chez moi, je pense qu\\'il a été sans doute déchiré, car je ne l\\'ai pas revu jusqu\\'à présent.\\nSi vous me prenez encore celui-ci, et qu\\'il lui arrive un malheur, vous ferez descendre mes cheveux blancs avec douleur dans le séjour des morts.\\nMaintenant, si je retourne auprès de ton serviteur, mon père, sans avoir avec nous l\\'enfant à l\\'âme duquel son âme est attachée,\\nil mourra, en voyant que l\\'enfant n\\'y est pas; et tes serviteurs feront descendre avec douleur dans le séjour des morts les cheveux blancs de ton serviteur, notre père.\\nCar ton serviteur a répondu pour l\\'enfant, en disant à mon père: Si je ne le ramène pas auprès de toi, je serai pour toujours coupable envers mon père.\\nPermets donc, je te prie, à ton serviteur de rester à la place de l\\'enfant, comme esclave de mon seigneur; et que l\\'enfant remonte avec ses frères.\\nComment pourrai-je remonter vers mon père, si l\\'enfant n\\'est pas avec moi? Ah! que je ne voie point l\\'affliction de mon père!\\nJoseph ne pouvait plus se contenir devant tous ceux qui l\\'entouraient. Il s\\'écria: Faites sortir tout le monde. Et il ne resta personne avec Joseph, quand il se fit connaître à ses frères.\\nIl éleva la voix, en pleurant. Les égyptiens l\\'entendirent, et la maison de Pharaon l\\'entendit.\\nJoseph dit à ses frères: Je suis Joseph! Mon père vit-il encore? Mais ses frères ne purent lui répondre, car ils étaient troublés en sa présence.\\nJoseph dit à ses frères: Approchez-vous de moi. Et ils s\\'approchèrent. Il dit: Je suis Joseph, votre frère, que vous avez vendu pour être mené en égypte.\\nMaintenant, ne vous affligez pas, et ne soyez pas fâchés de m\\'avoir vendu pour être conduit ici, car c\\'est pour vous sauver la vie que Dieu m\\'a envoyé devant vous.\\nVoilà deux ans que la famine est dans le pays; et pendant cinq années encore, il n\\'y aura ni labour, ni moisson.\\nDieu m\\'a envoyé devant vous pour vous faire subsister dans le pays, et pour vous faire vivre par une grande délivrance.\\nCe n\\'est donc pas vous qui m\\'avez envoyé ici, mais c\\'est Dieu; il m\\'a établi père de Pharaon, maître de toute sa maison, et gouverneur de tout le pays d\\'égypte.\\nHâtez-vous de remonter auprès de mon père, et vous lui direz: Ainsi a parlé ton fils Joseph: Dieu m\\'a établi seigneur de toute l\\'égypte; descends vers moi, ne tarde pas!\\nTu habiteras dans le pays de Gosen, et tu seras près de moi, toi, tes fils, et les fils de tes fils, tes brebis et tes boeufs, et tout ce qui est à toi.\\nLà, je te nourrirai, car il y aura encore cinq années de famine; et ainsi tu ne périras point, toi, ta maison, et tout ce qui est à toi.\\nVous voyez de vos yeux, et mon frère Benjamin voit de ses yeux que c\\'est moi-même qui vous parle.\\nRacontez à mon père toute ma gloire en égypte, et tout ce que vous avez vu; et vous ferez descendre ici mon père au plus tôt.\\nIl se jeta au cou de Benjamin, son frère, et pleura; et Benjamin pleura sur son cou.\\nIl embrassa aussi tous ses frères, en pleurant. Après quoi, ses frères s\\'entretinrent avec lui.\\nLe bruit se répandit dans la maison de Pharaon que les frères de Joseph étaient arrivés: ce qui fut agréable à Pharaon et à ses serviteurs.\\nPharaon dit à Joseph: Dis à tes frères: Faites ceci. Chargez vos bêtes, et partez pour le pays de Canaan;\\nprenez votre père et vos familles, et venez auprès de moi. Je vous donnerai ce qu\\'il y a de meilleur au pays d\\'égypte, et vous mangerez la graisse du pays.\\nTu as ordre de leur dire: Faites ceci. Prenez dans le pays d\\'égypte des chars pour vos enfants et pour vos femmes; amenez votre père, et venez.\\nNe regrettez point ce que vous laisserez, car ce qu\\'il a de meilleur dans tout le pays d\\'égypte sera pour vous.\\nLes fils d\\'Israël firent ainsi. Joseph leur donna des chars, selon l\\'ordre de Pharaon; il leur donna aussi des provisions pour la route.\\nIl leur donna à tous des vêtements de rechange, et il donna à Benjamin trois cents sicles d\\'argent et cinq vêtements de rechange.\\nIl envoya à son père dix ânes chargés de ce qu\\'il y avait de meilleur en égypte, et dix ânesses chargées de blé, de pain et de vivres, pour son père pendant le voyage.\\nPuis il congédia ses frères, qui partirent; et il leur dit: Ne vous querellez pas en chemin.\\nIls remontèrent de l\\'égypte, et ils arrivèrent dans le pays de Canaan, auprès de Jacob, leur père.\\nIls lui dirent: Joseph vit encore, et même c\\'est lui qui gouverne tout le pays d\\'égypte. Mais le coeur de Jacob resta froid, parce qu\\'il ne les croyait pas.\\nIls lui rapportèrent toutes les paroles que Joseph leur avait dites. Il vit les chars que Joseph avait envoyés pour le transporter. C\\'est alors que l\\'esprit de Jacob, leur père, se ranima;\\net Israël dit: C\\'est assez! Joseph, mon fils, vit encore! J\\'irai, et je le verrai avant que je meure.\\nIsraël partit, avec tout ce qui lui appartenait. Il arriva à Beer Schéba, et il offrit des sacrifices au Dieu de son père Isaac.\\nDieu parla à Israël dans une vision pendant la nuit, et il dit: Jacob! Jacob! Israël répondit: Me voici!\\nEt Dieu dit: Je suis le Dieu, le Dieu de ton père. Ne crains point de descendre en égypte, car là je te ferai devenir une grande nation.\\nMoi-même je descendrai avec toi en égypte, et moi-même je t\\'en ferai remonter; et Joseph te fermera les yeux.\\nJacob quitta Beer Schéba; et les fils d\\'Israël mirent Jacob, leur père, avec leurs enfants et leurs femmes, sur les chars que Pharaon avait envoyés pour les transporter.\\nIls prirent aussi leurs troupeaux et les biens qu\\'ils avaient acquis dans le pays de Canaan. Et Jacob se rendit en égypte, avec toute sa famille.\\nIl emmena avec lui en égypte ses fils et les fils de ses fils, ses filles et les filles de ses fils, et toute sa famille.\\nVoici les noms des fils d\\'Israël, qui vinrent en égypte. Jacob et ses fils. Premier-né de Jacob: Ruben.\\nFils de Ruben: Hénoc, Pallu, Hetsron et Carmi.\\nFils de Siméon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin et Tsochar; et Saul, fils de la Cananéenne.\\nFils de Lévi: Guerschon, Kehath et Merari.\\nFils de Juda: Er, Onan, Schéla, Pérets et Zarach; mais Er et Onan moururent au pays de Canaan.

En tout, sept personnes.\\nLes personnes qui vinrent avec Jacob en égypte, et qui étaient issues de lui, étaient au nombre de soixante-six en tout, sans compter les femmes des fils de Jacob.\\nEt Joseph avait deux fils qui lui étaient nés en égypte. Le total des personnes de la famille de Jacob qui vinrent en égypte était de soixante-dix.\\nJacob envoya Juda devant lui vers Joseph, pour l\\'informer qu\\'il se rendait en Gosen.\\nJoseph attela son char et y monta, pour aller en Gosen, à la rencontre d\\'Israël, son père. Dès qu\\'il le vit, il se jeta à son cou, et pleura longtemps sur son cou.\\nIsraël dit à Joseph: Que je meure maintenant, puisque j\\'ai vu ton visage et que tu vis encore!\\nJoseph dit à ses frères et à la famille de son père: Je vais avertir Pharaon, et je lui dirai: Mes frères et la famille de mon père, qui étaient au pays de Canaan, sont arrivés auprès de moi.\\nCes hommes sont bergers, car ils élèvent des troupeaux; ils ont amené leurs brebis et leurs boeufs, et tout ce qui leur appartient.\\nEt quand Pharaon vous appellera, et dira:\\nQuelle est votre occupation? vous répondrez: Tes serviteurs ont élevé des troupeaux, depuis notre jeunesse jusqu\\'à présent, nous et nos pères. De cette manière, vous habiterez dans le pays de Gosen, car tous les bergers sont en abomination aux égyptiens.\\nJoseph alla avertir Pharaon, et lui dit: Mes frères et mon père sont arrivés du pays de Canaan, avec leurs brebis et leurs boeufs, et tout ce qui leur appartient; et les voici dans le pays de Gosen.\\nIl prit cinq de ses frères, et les présenta à Pharaon.\\nPharaon leur dit: Quelle est votre occupation? Ils répondirent à Pharaon: Tes serviteurs sont bergers, comme l\\'étaient nos pères.\\nIls dirent encore à Pharaon: Nous sommes venus pour séjourner dans le pays, parce qu\\'il n\\'y a plus de pâturage pour les brebis de tes serviteurs, car la famine s\\'appesantit sur le pays de Canaan; permets donc à tes serviteurs d\\'habiter au pays de Gosen.\\nPharaon dit à Joseph: Ton père et tes frères sont venus auprès de toi.\\nLe pays d\\'égypte est devant toi; établis ton père et tes frères dans la meilleure partie du pays. Qu\\'ils habitent dans le pays de Gosen; et, si tu trouves parmi eux des hommes capables, mets-les à la tête de mes troupeaux.\\nJoseph fit venir Jacob, son père, et le présenta à Pharaon. Et Jacob bénit Pharaon.\\nPharaon dit à Jacob: Quel est le nombre de jours des années de ta vie?\\nJacob répondit à Pharaon: Les jours des années de mon pèlerinage sont de cent trente ans. Les jours des années de ma vie ont été peu nombreux et mauvais, et ils n\\'ont point atteint les jours des années de la vie de mes pères durant leur pèlerinage.\\nJacob bénit encore Pharaon, et se retira de devant Pharaon.\\nJoseph établit son père et ses frères, et leur donna une propriété dans le pays d\\'égypte, dans la meilleure partie du pays, dans la contrée de Ramsès, comme Pharaon l\\'avait ordonné.\\nJoseph fournit du pain à son père et à ses frères, et à toute la famille de son père, selon le nombre des enfants.\\nIl n\\'y avait plus de pain dans tout le pays, car la famine était très grande; le pays d\\'égypte et le pays de Canaan languissaient, à cause de la famine.\\nJoseph recueillit tout l\\'argent qui se trouvait dans le pays d\\'égypte et dans le pays de Canaan, contre le blé qu\\'on achetait; et il fit entrer cet argent dans la maison de Pharaon.\\nQuand l\\'argent du pays d\\'égypte et du pays de Canaan fut épuisé, tous les égyptiens vinrent à Joseph, en disant: Donne-nous du pain! Pourquoi mourrions-nous en ta présence? car l\\'argent manque.\\nJoseph dit: Donnez vos troupeaux, et je vous donnerai du pain contre vos troupeaux, si l\\'argent manque.\\nIls amenèrent leurs troupeaux à Joseph, et Joseph leur donna du pain contre les chevaux, contre les troupeaux de brebis et de boeufs, et contre les ânes. Il leur fournit ainsi du pain cette année-là contre tous leurs troupeaux.\\nLorsque cette année fut écoulée, ils vinrent à Joseph l\\'année suivante, et lui dirent: Nous ne cacherons point à mon seigneur que l\\'argent est épuisé, et que les troupeaux de bétail ont été amenés à mon seigneur; il ne reste devant mon seigneur que nos corps et nos terres.\\nPourquoi mourrions-nous sous tes yeux, nous et nos terres? Achète-nous avec nos terres contre du pain, et nous appartiendrons à mon seigneur, nous et nos terres. Donne-nous de quoi semer, afin que nous vivions et que nous ne mourions pas, et que nos terres ne soient pas désolées.\\nJoseph acheta toutes les terres de l\\'égypte pour Pharaon; car les égyptiens vendirent chacun leur champ, parce que la famine les pressait. Et le pays devint la propriété de Pharaon.\\nIl fit passer le peuple dans les villes, d\\'un bout à l\\'autre des frontières de l\\'égypte.\\nSeulement, il n\\'acheta point les terres des prêtres, parce qu\\'il y avait une loi de Pharaon en faveur des prêtres, qui vivaient du revenu que leur assurait Pharaon: c\\'est pourquoi ils ne vendirent point leurs terres.\\nJoseph dit au peuple: Je vous ai achetés aujourd\\'hui avec vos terres, pour Pharaon; voici pour vous de la semence, et vous pourrez ensemencer le sol.\\nA la récolte, vous donnerez un cinquième à Pharaon, et vous aurez les quatre autres parties, pour ensemencer les champs, et pour vous nourrir avec vos enfants et ceux qui sont dans vos maisons.\\nIls dirent: Tu nous sauves la vie! que nous trouvions grâce aux yeux de mon seigneur, et nous serons esclaves de Pharaon.\\nJoseph fit de cela une loi, qui a subsisté jusqu\\'à ce jour, et d\\'après laquelle un cinquième du revenu des terres de l\\'égypte appartient à Pharaon; il n\\'y a que les terres des prêtres qui ne soient point à Pharaon.\\nIsraël habita dans le pays d\\'égypte, dans le pays de Gosen. Ils eurent des possessions, ils furent féconds et multiplièrent beaucoup.\\nJacob vécut dix-sept ans dans le pays d\\'égypte; et les jours des années de la vie de Jacob furent de cent quarante-sept ans.\\nLorsqu\\'Israël approcha du moment de sa mort, il appela son fils Joseph, et lui dit: Si j\\'ai trouvé grâce à tes yeux, mets, je te prie, ta main sous ma cuisse, et use envers moi de bonté et de fidélité: ne m\\'enterre pas en égypte!\\nQuand je serai couché avec mes pères, tu me transporteras hors de l\\'égypte, et tu m\\'enterreras dans leur sépulcre. Joseph répondit: Je ferai selon ta parole.\\nJacob dit: Jure-le-moi. Et Joseph le lui jura. Puis Israël se prosterna sur le chevet de son lit.\\nAprès ces choses, l\\'on vint dire à Joseph: Voici, ton père est malade. Et il prit avec lui ses deux fils, Manassé et éphraïm.\\nOn avertit Jacob, et on lui dit: Voici ton fils Joseph qui vient vers toi. Et Israël rassembla ses forces, et s\\'assit sur son lit.\\nJacob dit à Joseph: Le Dieu tout puissant m\\'est apparu à Luz, dans le pays de Canaan, et il m\\'a béni.\\nIl m\\'a dit: Je te rendrai fécond, je te multiplierai, et je ferai de toi une multitude de peuples; je donnerai ce pays à ta postérité après toi, pour qu\\'elle le possède à toujours.\\nMaintenant, les deux fils qui te sont nés au pays d\\'égypte, avant mon arrivée vers toi en égypte, seront à moi; éphraïm et Manassé seront à moi, comme Ruben et Siméon.\\nMais les enfants que tu as engendrés après eux seront à toi; ils seront appelés du nom de leurs frères dans leur héritage.\\nA mon retour de Paddan, Rachel mourut en route auprès de moi, dans le pays de Canaan, à quelque distance d\\'éphrata; et c\\'est là que je l\\'ai enterrée, sur le chemin d\\'éphrata, qui est Bethléhem.\\nIsraël regarda les fils de Joseph, et dit: Qui sont ceux-ci?\\nJoseph répondit à son père: Ce sont mes fils, que Dieu m\\'a donnés ici. Israël dit: Fais-les, je te prie, approcher de moi, pour que je les bénisse.\\nLes yeux d\\'Israël étaient appesantis par la vieillesse; il ne pouvait plus voir. Joseph les fit approcher de lui; et Israël leur donna un baiser, et les embrassa.\\nIsraël dit à Joseph: Je ne pensais pas revoir ton visage, et voici que Dieu me fait voir même ta postérité.\\nJoseph les retira des genoux de son père, et il se prosterna en terre devant lui.\\nPuis Joseph les prit tous deux, éphraïm de sa main droite à la gauche d\\'Israël, et Manassé de sa main gauche à la droite d\\'Israël, et il les fit approcher de lui.\\nIsraël étendit sa main droite et la posa sur la tête d\\'éphraïm qui était le plus jeune, et il posa sa main gauche sur la tête de Manassé: ce fut avec intention qu\\'il posa ses mains ainsi, car Manassé était le premier-né.\\nIl bénit Joseph, et dit: Que le Dieu en présence duquel ont marché mes pères, Abraham et Isaac, que le Dieu qui m\\'a conduit depuis que j\\'existe jusqu\\'à ce jour,\\nque l\\'ange qui m\\'a délivré de tout mal, bénisse ces enfants! Qu\\'ils soient appelés de mon nom et du nom de mes pères, Abraham et Isaac, et qu\\'ils multiplient en abondance au milieu du pays!\\nJoseph vit avec déplaisir que son père posait sa main droite sur la tête d\\'éphraïm; il saisit la main de son père, pour la détourner de dessus la tête d\\'éphraïm, et la diriger sur celle de Manassé.\\nEt Joseph dit à son père: Pas ainsi, mon père, car celui-ci est le premier-né; pose ta main droite sur sa tête.\\nSon père refusa, et dit: Je le sais, mon fils, je le sais; lui aussi deviendra un peuple, lui aussi sera grand; mais son frère cadet sera plus grand que lui, et sa postérité deviendra une multitude de nations.\\nIl les bénit ce jour-là, et dit: C\\'est par toi qu\\'Israël bénira, en disant: Que Dieu te traite comme éphraïm et comme Manassé! Et il mit éphraïm avant Manassé.\\nIsraël dit à Joseph: Voici, je vais mourir! Mais Dieu sera avec vous, et il vous fera retourner dans le pays de vos pères.\\nJe te donne, de plus qu\\'à tes frères, une part que j\\'ai prise de la main des Amoréens avec mon épée et avec mon arc.\\nJacob appela ses fils, et dit: Assemblez-vous, et je vous annoncerai ce qui vous arrivera dans la suite des temps.\\nRassemblez-vous, et écoutez, fils de Jacob! écoutez Israël, votre père!\\nRuben, toi, mon premier-né, Ma force et les prémices de ma vigueur, Supérieur en dignité et supérieur en puissance,\\nImpétueux comme les eaux, tu n\\'auras pas la prééminence! Car tu es monté sur la couche de ton père, Tu as souillé ma couche en y montant.\\nSiméon et Lévi sont frères; Leurs glaives sont des instruments de violence.\\nQue mon âme n\\'entre point dans leur conciliabule, Que mon esprit ne s\\'unisse point à leur assemblée! Car, dans leur colère, ils ont tué des hommes, Et, dans leur méchanceté, ils ont coupé les jarrets des taureaux.\\nMaudite soit leur colère, car elle est violente, Et leur fureur, car elle est cruelle! Je les séparerai dans Jacob, Et je les disperserai dans Israël.\\nJuda, tu recevras les hommages de tes frères; Ta main sera sur la nuque de tes ennemis. Les fils de ton père se prosterneront devant toi.\\nJuda est un jeune lion. Tu reviens du carnage, mon fils! Il ploie les genoux, il se couche comme un lion, Comme une lionne: qui le fera lever?\\nLe sceptre ne s\\'éloignera point de Juda, Ni le bâton souverain d\\'entre ses pieds, Jusqu\\'à ce que vienne le Schilo, Et que les peuples lui obéissent.\\nIl attache à la vigne son âne, Et au meilleur cep le petit de son ânesse; Il lave dans le vin son vêtement, Et dans le sang des raisins son manteau.\\nIl a les yeux rouges de vin, Et les dents blanches de lait.\\nZabulon habitera sur la côte des mers, Il sera sur la côte des navires, Et sa limite s\\'étendra du côté de Sidon.\\nIssacar est un âne robuste, Qui se couche dans les étables.\\nIl voit que le lieu où il repose est agréable, Et que la contrée est magnifique; Et il courbe son épaule sous le fardeau, Il s\\'assujettit à un tribut.\\nDan jugera son peuple, Comme l\\'une des tribus d\\'Israël.\\nDan sera un serpent sur le chemin, Une vipère sur le sentier, Mordant les talons du cheval, Pour que le cavalier tombe à la renverse.\\nJ\\'espère en ton secours, ô éternel!\\nGad sera assailli par des bandes armées, Mais il les assaillira et les poursuivra.\\nAser produit une nourriture excellente; Il fournira les mets délicats des rois.\\nNephthali est une biche en liberté; Il profère de belles paroles.\\nJoseph est le rejeton d\\'un arbre fertile, Le rejeton d\\'un arbre fertile près d\\'une source; Les branches s\\'élèvent au-dessus de la muraille.\\nIls l\\'ont provoqué, ils ont lancé des traits; Les archers l\\'ont poursuivi de leur haine.\\nMais son arc est demeuré ferme, Et ses mains ont été fortifiées Par les mains du Puissant de Jacob: Il est ainsi devenu le berger, le rocher d\\'Israël.\\nC\\'est l\\'oeuvre du Dieu de ton père, qui t\\'aidera; C\\'est l\\'oeuvre du Tout puissant, qui te bénira Des bénédictions des cieux en haut, Des bénédictions des eaux en bas, Des bénédictions des mamelles et du sein maternel.\\nLes bénédictions de ton père s\\'élèvent Au-dessus des bénédictions de mes pères Jusqu\\'à la cime des collines éternelles: Qu\\'elles soient sur la tête de Joseph, Sur le sommet de la tête du prince de ses frères!\\nBenjamin est un loup qui déchire; Le matin, il dévore la proie, Et le soir, il partage le butin.\\nCe sont là tous ceux qui forment les douze tribus d\\'Israël. Et c\\'est là ce que leur dit leur père, en les bénissant. Il les bénit, chacun selon sa bénédiction.\\nPuis il leur donna cet ordre: Je vais être recueilli auprès de mon peuple; enterrez-moi avec mes pères, dans la caverne qui est au champ d\\'éphron, le Héthien,\\ndans la caverne du champ de Macpéla, vis-à-vis de Mamré, dans le pays de Canaan. C\\'est le champ qu\\'Abraham a acheté d\\'éphron, le Héthien, comme propriété sépulcrale.\\nLà on a enterré Abraham et Sara, sa femme; là on a enterré Isaac et Rebecca, sa femme; et là j\\'ai enterré Léa.\\nLe champ et la caverne qui s\\'y trouve ont été achetés des fils de Heth.\\nLorsque Jacob eut achevé de donner ses ordres à ses fils, il retira ses pieds dans le lit, il expira, et fut recueilli auprès de son peuple.\\nJoseph se jeta sur le visage de son père, pleura sur lui, et le baisa.\\nIl ordonna aux médecins à son service d\\'embaumer son père, et les médecins embaumèrent Israël.\\nQuarante jours s\\'écoulèrent ainsi, et furent employés à l\\'embaumer. Et les égyptiens le pleurèrent soixante-dix jours.\\nQuand les jours du deuil furent passés, Joseph s\\'adressa aux gens de la maison de Pharaon, et leur dit: Si j\\'ai trouvé grâce à vos yeux, rapportez, je vous prie, à Pharaon ce que je vous dis.\\nMon père m\\'a fait jurer, en disant: Voici, je vais mourir! Tu m\\'enterreras dans le sépulcre que je me suis acheté au pays de Canaan. Je voudrais donc y monter, pour enterrer mon père; et je reviendrai.\\nPharaon répondit: Monte, et enterre ton père, comme il te l\\'a fait jurer.\\nJoseph monta, pour enterrer son père. Avec lui montèrent tous les serviteurs de Pharaon, anciens de sa maison, tous les anciens du pays d\\'égypte,\\ntoute la maison de Joseph, ses frères, et la maison de son père: on ne laissa dans le pays de Gosen que les enfants, les brebis et les boeufs.\\nIl y avait encore avec Joseph des chars et des cavaliers, en sorte que le cortège était très nombreux.\\nArrivés à l\\'aire d\\'Athad, qui est au delà du Jourdain, ils firent entendre de grandes et profondes lamentations; et Joseph fit en l\\'honneur de son père un deuil de sept jours.\\nLes habitants du pays, les Cananéens, furent témoins de ce deuil dans l\\'aire d\\'Athad, et ils dirent: Voilà un grand deuil parmi les égyptiens! C\\'est pourquoi l\\'on a donné le nom d\\'Abel Mitsraïm à cette aire qui est au delà du Jourdain.\\nC\\'est ainsi que les fils de Jacob exécutèrent les ordres de leur père.\\nIls le transportèrent au pays de Canaan, et l\\'enterrèrent dans la caverne du champ de Macpéla, qu\\'Abraham avait achetée d\\'éphron, le Héthien, comme propriété sépulcrale, et qui est vis-à-vis de Mamré.\\nJoseph, après avoir enterré son père, retourna en égypte, avec ses frères et tous ceux qui étaient montés avec lui pour enterrer son père.\\nQuand les frères de Joseph virent que leur père était mort, ils dirent: Si Joseph nous prenait en haine, et nous rendait tout le mal que nous lui avons fait!\\nEt ils firent dire à Joseph: Ton père a donné cet ordre avant de mourir:\\nVous parlerez ainsi à Joseph: Oh! pardonne le crime de tes frères et leur péché, car ils t\\'ont fait du mal! Pardonne maintenant le péché des serviteurs du Dieu de ton père! Joseph pleura, en entendant ces paroles.\\nSes frères vinrent eux-mêmes se prosterner devant lui, et ils dirent: Nous sommes tes serviteurs.\\nJoseph leur dit: Soyez sans crainte; car suis-je à la place de Dieu?\\nVous aviez médité de me faire du mal: Dieu l\\'a changé en bien, pour accomplir ce qui arrive aujourd\\'hui, pour sauver la vie à un peuple nombreux.\\nSoyez donc sans crainte; je vous entretiendrai, vous et vos enfants. Et il les consola, en parlant à leur coeur.\\nJoseph demeura en égypte, lui et la maison de son père. Il vécut cent dix ans.\\nJoseph vit les fils d\\'éphraïm jusqu\\'à la troisième génération; et les fils de Makir, fils de Manassé, naquirent sur ses genoux.\\nJoseph dit à ses frères: Je vais mourir! Mais Dieu vous visitera, et il vous fera remonter de ce pays-ci dans le pays qu\\'il a juré de donner à Abraham, à Isaac et à Jacob.\\nJoseph fit jurer les fils d\\'Israël, en disant: Dieu vous visitera; et vous ferez remonter mes os loin d\\'ici.\\nJoseph mourut, âgé de cent dix ans. On l\\'embauma, et on le mit dans un cercueil en égypte.\\nAm Anfang schuf Gott Himmel und Erde.\\nUnd die Erde war wüst und leer, und es war finster auf der Tiefe; und der Geist Gottes schwebte auf dem Wasser.\\nUnd Gott sprach: Es werde Licht! Und es ward Licht.\\nUnd Gott sah, da&szlig; das Licht gut war. Da schied Gott das Licht von der Finsternis\\nund nannte das Licht Tag und die Finsternis Nacht. Da ward aus Abend und Morgen der erste Tag.\\nUnd Gott sprach: Es werde eine Feste zwischen den Wassern, die da scheide zwischen den Wassern.\\nDa machte Gott die Feste und schied das Wasser unter der Feste von dem Wasser über der Feste. Und es geschah so.\\nUnd Gott nannte die Feste Himmel. Da ward aus Abend und Morgen der zweite Tag.\\nUnd Gott sprach: Es sammle sich das Wasser unter dem Himmel an besondere Orte, da&szlig; man das Trockene sehe. Und es geschah so.\\nUnd Gott nannte das Trockene Erde, und die Sammlung der Wasser nannte er Meer. Und Gott sah, da&szlig; es gut war.\\nUnd Gott sprach: Es lasse die Erde aufgehen Gras und Kraut, das Samen bringe, und fruchtbare Bäume auf Erden, die ein jeder nach seiner Art Früchte tragen, in denen ihr Same ist. Und es geschah so.\\nUnd die Erde lie&szlig; aufgehen Gras und Kraut, das Samen bringt, ein jedes nach seiner Art, und Bäume, die da Früchte tragen, in denen ihr Same ist, ein jeder nach seiner Art. Und Gott sah, da&szlig; es gut war.\\nDa ward aus Abend und Morgen der dritte Tag.\\nUnd Gott sprach: Es werden Lichter an der Feste des Himmels, die da scheiden Tag und Nacht und geben Zeichen, Zeiten, Tage und Jahre\\nund seien Lichter an der Feste des Himmels, da&szlig; sie scheinen auf die Erde. Und es geschah so.\\nUnd Gott machte zwei gro&szlig;e Lichter: ein gro&szlig;es Licht, das den Tag regiere, und ein kleines Licht, das die Nacht regiere, dazu auch die Sterne.\\nUnd Gott setzte sie an die Feste des Himmels, da&szlig; sie schienen auf die Erde\\nund den Tag und die Nacht regierten und schieden Licht und Finsternis. Und Gott sah, da&szlig; es gut war.\\nDa ward aus Abend und Morgen der vierte Tag.\\nUnd Gott sprach: Es wimmle das Wasser von lebendigem Getier, und Vögel sollen fliegen auf Erden unter der Feste des Himmels.\\nUnd Gott schuf gro&szlig;e Walfische und alles Getier, das da lebt und webt, davon das Wasser wimmelt, ein jedes nach seiner Art, und alle gefiederten Vögel, einen jeden nach seiner Art. Und Gott sah, da&szlig; es gut war.\\nUnd Gott segnete sie und sprach: Seid fruchtbar und mehret euch und erfüllet das Wasser im Meer, und die Vögel sollen sich mehren auf Erden.\\nDa ward aus Abend und Morgen der fünfte Tag.\\nUnd Gott sprach: Die Erde bringe hervor lebendiges Getier, ein jedes nach seiner Art: Vieh, Gewürm und Tiere des Feldes, ein jedes nach seiner Art. Und es geschah so.\\nUnd Gott machte die Tiere des Feldes, ein jedes nach seiner Art, und das Vieh nach seiner Art und alles Gewürm des Erdbodens nach seiner Art. Und Gott sah, da&szlig; es gut war.\\nUnd Gott sprach: Lasset uns Menschen machen, ein Bild, das uns gleich sei, die da herrschen über die Fische im Meer und über die Vögel unter dem Himmel und über das Vieh und über alle Tiere des Feldes und über alles Gewürm, das auf Erden kriecht.\\nUnd Gott schuf den Menschen zu seinem Bilde, zum Bilde Gottes schuf er ihn; und schuf sie als Mann und Weib.\\nUnd Gott segnete sie und sprach zu ihnen: Seid fruchtbar und mehret euch und füllet die Erde und machet sie euch untertan und herrschet über die Fische im Meer und über die Vögel unter dem Himmel und über das Vieh und über alles Getier, das auf Erden kriecht.\\nUnd Gott sprach: Sehet da, ich habe euch gegeben alle Pflanzen, die Samen bringen, auf der ganzen Erde, und alle Bäume mit Früchten, die Samen bringen, zu eurer Speise.\\nAber allen Tieren auf Erden und allen Vögeln unter dem Himmel und allem Gewürm, das auf Erden lebt, habe ich alles grüne Kraut zur Nahrung gegeben.

Josef sprach: Auslegen gehört Gott zu; doch erzählt mir\\'s.\\nDa erzählte der oberste Schenk seinen Traum und sprach zu Josef: Mir hat geträumt, da&szlig; ein Weinstock vor mir wäre,\\nder hatte drei Reben, und er grünte, wuchs und blühte, und seine Trauben wurden reif.\\nUnd ich hatte den Becher des Pharao in meiner Hand und nahm die Beeren und zerdrückte sie in den Becher und gab den Becher dem Pharao in die Hand.\\nJosef sprach zu ihm: Das ist seine Deutung: Drei Reben sind drei Tage.\\nNach drei Tagen wird der Pharao dein Haupt erheben und dich wieder in dein Amt setzen, da&szlig; du ihm den Becher in die Hand gebest wie vormals, als du sein Schenk warst.\\nAber gedenke meiner, wenn dir\\'s wohlgeht, und tu Barmherzigkeit an mir, da&szlig; du dem Pharao von mir sagst und mich so aus diesem Hause bringst.\\nDenn ich bin aus dem Lande der Hebräer heimlich gestohlen worden; und auch hier hab ich nichts getan, weswegen sie mich hätten ins Gefängnis setzen dürfen.\\nAls der oberste Bäcker sah, da&szlig; die Deutung gut war, sprach er zu Josef: Mir hat auch geträumt, ich trüge drei Körbe mit feinem Backwerk auf meinem Haupt\\nund im obersten Korbe allerlei Gebackenes für den Pharao, und die Vögel fra&szlig;en aus dem Korbe auf meinem Haupt.\\nJosef antwortete und sprach: Das ist seine Deutung: Drei Körbe sind drei Tage.\\nUnd nach drei Tagen wird der Pharao dein Haupt erheben und dich an den Galgen hängen, und die Vögel werden dein Fleisch von dir fressen.\\nUnd es geschah am dritten Tage, da beging der Pharao seinen Geburtstag. Und er machte ein Festmahl für alle seine Gro&szlig;en und erhob das Haupt des obersten Schenken und das Haupt des obersten Bäckers unter seinen Gro&szlig;en\\nund setzte den obersten Schenken wieder in sein Amt, da&szlig; er den Becher reiche in des Pharao Hand,\\naber den obersten Bäcker lie&szlig; er aufhängen, wie ihnen Josef gedeutet hatte.\\nAber der oberste Schenk dachte nicht an Josef, sondern verga&szlig; ihn. \\n</P><hr><h3>41. Kapitel</h3><h3>Josef deutet die Träume des Pharao</h3>\\n<p>Und nach zwei Jahren hatte der Pharao einen Traum, er stünde am Nil\\nund sähe aus dem Wasser steigen sieben schöne, fette Kühe; die gingen auf der Weide im Grase.\\nNach diesen sah er andere sieben Kühe aus dem Wasser aufsteigen; die waren hä&szlig;lich und mager und traten neben die Kühe am Ufer des Nils.\\nUnd die hä&szlig;lichen und mageren fra&szlig;en die sieben schönen, fetten Kühe. Da erwachte der Pharao.\\nUnd er schlief wieder ein, und ihm träumte abermals, und er sah, da&szlig; sieben Ähren aus einem Halm wuchsen, voll und dick.\\nDanach sah er sieben dünne Ähren aufgehen, die waren vom Ostwind versengt.\\nUnd die sieben mageren Ähren verschlangen die sieben dicken und vollen Ähren. Da erwachte der Pharao und merkte, da&szlig; es ein Traum war.\\nUnd als es Morgen wurde, war sein Geist bekümmert, und er schickte aus und lie&szlig; rufen alle Wahrsager in Ägypten und alle Weisen und erzählte ihnen seine Träume. Aber da war keiner, der sie dem Pharao deuten konnte.\\nDa redete der oberste Schenk zum Pharao und sprach: Ich mu&szlig; heute an meine Sünden denken:\\nAls der Pharao zornig wurde über seine Knechte und mich mit dem obersten Bäcker ins Gefängnis legte in des Amtmanns Hause,\\nda träumte uns beiden in einer Nacht einem jeden sein Traum, dessen Deutung ihn betraf.\\nDa war bei uns ein hebräischer Jüngling, des Amtmanns Knecht, dem erzählten wir\\'s. Und er deutete uns unsere Träume, einem jeden nach seinem Traum.\\nUnd wie er uns deutete, so ist\\'s gekommen; denn ich bin wieder in mein Amt gesetzt, aber jener wurde aufgehängt.\\nDa sandte der Pharao hin und lie&szlig; Josef rufen, und sie lie&szlig;en ihn eilends aus dem Gefängnis. Und er lie&szlig; sich scheren und zog andere Kleider an und kam hinein zum Pharao.\\nDa sprach der Pharao zu ihm: Ich habe einen Traum gehabt, und es ist niemand, der ihn deuten kann. Ich habe aber von dir sagen hören, wenn du einen Traum hörst, so kannst du ihn deuten.\\nJosef antwortete dem Pharao und sprach: Das steht nicht bei mir; Gott wird jedoch dem Pharao Gutes verkünden.\\nDer Pharao sprach zu Josef: Mir träumte, ich stand am Ufer des Nils\\nund sah aus dem Wasser steigen sieben schöne, fette Kühe; die gingen auf der Weide im Grase.\\nUnd nach ihnen sah ich andere sieben dürre, sehr hä&szlig;liche und magere Kühe heraussteigen. Ich hab in ganz Ägyptenland nicht so hä&szlig;liche gesehen.\\nUnd die sieben mageren und hä&szlig;lichen Kühe fra&szlig;en die sieben ersten, fetten Kühe auf.\\nUnd als sie die hineingefressen hatten, merkte man\\'s ihnen nicht an, da&szlig; sie die gefressen hatten, und waren hä&szlig;lich wie zuvor. Da wachte ich auf.\\nUnd ich sah abermals in meinem Traum sieben Ähren auf einem Halm wachsen, voll und dick.\\nDanach gingen auf sieben dürre Ähren, dünn und versengt.\\nUnd die sieben dünnen Ähren verschlangen die sieben dicken Ähren. Und ich habe es den Wahrsagern gesagt, aber die können\\'s mir nicht deuten.\\nJosef antwortete dem Pharao: Beide Träume des Pharao bedeuten das gleiche. Gott verkündet dem Pharao, was er vorhat.\\nDie sieben schönen Kühe sind sieben Jahre, und die sieben guten Ähren sind dieselben sieben Jahre. Es ist ein und derselbe Traum.\\nDie sieben mageren und hä&szlig;lichen Kühe, die nach jenen aufgestiegen sind, das sind sieben Jahre, und die sieben mageren und versengten Ähren sind sieben Jahre des Hungers.\\nDas meinte ich, wenn ich gesagt habe zum Pharao, da&szlig; Gott dem Pharao zeigt, was er vorhat.\\nSiehe, sieben reiche Jahre werden kommen in ganz Ägyptenland.\\nUnd nach ihnen werden sieben Jahre des Hungers kommen, so da&szlig; man vergessen wird alle Fülle in Ägyptenland. Und der Hunger wird das Land verzehren,\\nda&szlig; man nichts wissen wird von der Fülle im Lande vor der Hungersnot, die danach kommt; denn sie wird sehr schwer sein.\\nDa&szlig; aber dem Pharao zweimal geträumt hat, bedeutet, da&szlig; Gott solches gewi&szlig; und eilends tun wird.\\nNun sehe der Pharao nach einem verständigen und weisen Mann, den er über Ägyptenland setze,\\nund sorge dafür, da&szlig; er Amtleute verordne im Lande und nehme den Fünften in Ägyptenland in den sieben reichen Jahren\\nund lasse sie sammeln den ganzen Ertrag der guten Jahre, die kommen werden, da&szlig; sie Getreide aufschütten in des Pharao Kornhäusern zum Vorrat in den Städten und es verwahren,\\ndamit für Nahrung gesorgt sei für das Land in den sieben Jahren des Hungers, die über Ägyptenland kommen werden, und das Land nicht vor Hunger verderbe.\\n[Note: Josefs Erhöhung]Die Rede gefiel dem Pharao und allen seinen Gro&szlig;en gut.\\nUnd der Pharao sprach zu seinen Gro&szlig;en: Wie könnten wir einen Mann finden, in dem der Geist Gottes ist wie in diesem?a\\nUnd er sprach zu Josef: Weil dir Gott dies alles kundgetan hat, ist keiner so verständig und weise wie du.\\nDu sollst über mein Haus sein, und deinem Wort soll all mein Volk gehorsam sein; allein um den königlichen Thron will ich höher sein als du.\\nUnd weiter sprach der Pharao zu Josef: Siehe, ich habe dich über ganz Ägyptenland gesetzt.\\nUnd er tat seinen Ring von seiner Hand und gab ihn Josef an seine Hand und kleidete ihn mit kostbarer Leinwand und legte ihm eine goldene Kette um seinen Hals\\nund lie&szlig; ihn auf seinem zweiten Wagen fahren und lie&szlig; vor ihm her ausrufen: Der ist des Landes Vater! Und setzte ihn über ganz Ägyptenland.\\nUnd der Pharao sprach zu Josef: Ich bin der Pharao, aber ohne deinen Willen soll niemand seine Hand oder seinen Fu&szlig; regen in ganz Ägyptenland.\\nUnd er nannte ihn Zafenat-Paneach und gab ihm zur Frau Asenat, die Tochter Potiferas, des Priesters zu On.\\nUnd Josef war drei&szlig;ig Jahre alt, als er vor dem Pharao stand, dem König von Ägypten. Und er ging hinweg vom Pharao und zog durch ganz Ägyptenland.\\n[Note: Josefs Fürsorge für Ägypten. Die Geburt seiner Söhne]Und das Land trug in den sieben reichen Jahren die Fülle.\\nUnd Josef sammelte die ganze Ernte der sieben Jahre, da Überflu&szlig; im Lande Ägypten war, und tat sie in die Städte. Was an Getreide auf dem Felde rings um eine jede Stadt wuchs, das tat er hinein.\\nSo schüttete Josef das Getreide auf, über die Ma&szlig;en viel wie Sand am Meer, so da&szlig; er aufhörte zu zählen; denn man konnte es nicht zählen.\\nUnd Josef wurden zwei Söhne geboren, bevor die Hungerzeit kam; die gebar ihm Asenat, die Tochter Potiferas, des Priesters zu On.\\nUnd er nannte den ersten Manasse; denn Gott, sprach er, hat mich vergessen lassen all mein Unglück und mein ganzes Vaterhaus.\\nDen andern nannte er Ephraim; denn Gott, sprach er, hat mich wachsen lassen in dem Lande meines Elends.\\nAls nun die sieben reichen Jahre um waren im Lande Ägypten,\\nda fingen an die sieben Hungerjahre zu kommen, wie Josef gesagt hatte. Und es ward eine Hungersnot in allen Landen, aber in ganz Ägyptenland war Brot.\\nAls nun ganz Ägyptenland auch Hunger litt, schrie das Volk zum Pharao um Brot. Aber der Pharao sprach zu allen Ägyptern: Geht hin zu Josef; was der euch sagt, das tut.\\nAls nun im ganzen Lande Hungersnot war, tat Josef alle Kornhäuser auf und verkaufte den Ägyptern; denn der Hunger ward je länger je grö&szlig;er im Lande.\\nUnd alle Welt kam nach Ägypten, um bei Josef zu kaufen; denn der Hunger war gro&szlig; in allen Landen. \\n</P><hr><h3>42. Kapitel</h3><h3>Erste Reise der Söhne Jakobs nach Ägypten</h3>\\n<p>Als aber Jakob sah, da&szlig; Getreide in Ägypten zu haben war, sprach er zu seinen Söhnen: Was seht ihr euch lange an?\\nSiehe, ich höre, es sei in Ägypten Getreide zu haben; zieht hinab und kauft uns Getreide, da&szlig; wir leben und nicht sterben.\\nDa zogen hinab zehn Brüder Josefs, um in Ägypten Getreide zu kaufen.\\nAber den Benjamin, Josefs Bruder, lie&szlig; Jakob nicht mit seinen Brüdern ziehen; denn er sprach: Es könnte ihm ein Unfall begegnen.\\nSo kamen die Söhne Israels, Getreide zu kaufen, samt andern, die mit ihnen zogen; denn es war auch im Lande Kanaan Hungersnot.\\nAber Josef war der Regent im Lande und verkaufte Getreide allem Volk im Lande. Als nun seine Brüder kamen, fielen sie vor ihm nieder zur Erde auf ihr Antlitz.\\nUnd er sah sie an und erkannte sie, aber er stellte sich fremd gegen sie und redete hart mit ihnen und sprach zu ihnen: Woher kommt ihr? Sie sprachen: Aus dem Lande Kanaan, Getreide zu kaufen.\\nAber wiewohl er sie erkannte, erkannten sie ihn doch nicht.\\nUnd Josef dachte an die Träume, die er von ihnen geträumt hatte, und sprach zu ihnen: Ihr seid Kundschafter und seid gekommen zu sehen, wo das Land offen ist.\\nSie antworteten ihm: Nein, mein Herr! Deine Knechte sind gekommen, Getreide zu kaufen.\\nWir sind alle eines Mannes Söhne; wir sind redlich, und deine Knechte sind nie Kundschafter gewesen.\\nEr sprach zu ihnen: Nein, sondern ihr seid gekommen zu sehen, wo das Land offen ist.\\nSie antworteten ihm: Wir, deine Knechte, sind zwölf Brüder, eines Mannes Söhne im Lande Kanaan, und der jüngste ist noch bei unserm Vater, aber der eine ist nicht mehr vorhanden.\\nJosef sprach zu ihnen: Es ist, wie ich euch gesagt habe: Kundschafter seid ihr.\\nDaran will ich euch prüfen: So wahr der Pharao lebt: ihr sollt nicht von hier wegkommen, es komme denn her euer jüngster Bruder!\\nSendet einen von euch hin, der euren Bruder hole, ihr aber sollt gefangen sein. Daran will ich prüfen eure Rede, ob ihr mit Wahrheit umgeht. Andernfalls - so wahr der Pharao lebt! - seid ihr Kundschafter!\\nUnd er lie&szlig; sie zusammen in Gewahrsam legen drei Tage lang.\\nAm dritten Tage aber sprach er zu ihnen: Wollt ihr leben, so tut nun dies, denn ich fürchte Gott:\\nSeid ihr redlich, so la&szlig;t einen eurer Brüder gebunden liegen in eurem Gefängnis; ihr aber zieht hin und bringt heim, was ihr gekauft habt für den Hunger.\\nUnd bringt euren jüngsten Bruder zu mir, so will ich euren Worten glauben, so da&szlig; ihr nicht sterben mü&szlig;t. Und sie gingen darauf ein.\\nSie sprachen aber untereinander: Das haben wir an unserem Bruder verschuldet! Denn wir sahen die Angst seiner Seele, als er uns anflehte, und wir wollten ihn nicht erhören; darum kommt nun diese Trübsal über uns.\\nRuben antwortete ihnen und sprach: Sagte ich\\'s euch nicht, als ich sprach: Versündigt euch nicht an dem Knaben, doch ihr wolltet nicht hören? Nun wird sein Blut gefordert.\\nSie wu&szlig;ten aber nicht, da&szlig; es Josef verstand; denn er redete mit ihnen durch einen Dolmetscher.\\nUnd er wandte sich von ihnen und weinte. Als er sich nun wieder zu ihnen wandte und mit ihnen redete, nahm er aus ihrer Mitte Simeon und lie&szlig; ihn binden vor ihren Augen.\\nUnd Josef gab Befehl, ihre Säcke mit Getreide zu füllen und ihnen ihr Geld wiederzugeben, einem jeden in seinen Sack, dazu auch Zehrung auf den Weg; und so tat man ihnen.\\nUnd sie luden ihre Ware auf ihre Esel und zogen von dannen.\\nAls aber einer seinen Sack auftat, da&szlig; er seinem Esel Futter gäbe in der Herberge, sah er sein Geld, das oben im Sack lag,\\nund sprach zu seinen Brüdern: Mein Geld ist wieder da, siehe, in meinem Sack ist es! Da entfiel ihnen ihr Herz, und sie blickten einander erschrocken an und sprachen: Warum hat Gott uns das angetan?\\nAls sie nun heimkamen zu ihrem Vater Jakob ins Land Kanaan, sagten sie ihm alles, was ihnen begegnet war, und sprachen:\\nDer Mann, der im Lande Herr ist, redete hart mit uns und hielt uns für Kundschafter.\\nUnd wir antworteten ihm: Wir sind redlich und nie Kundschafter gewesen,\\nsondern zwölf Brüder, unseres Vaters Söhne; einer ist nicht mehr vorhanden, und der jüngste ist noch bei unserm Vater im Lande Kanaan.\\nDa sprach der Herr im Lande zu uns: Daran will ich merken, ob ihr redlich seid: einen eurer Brüder la&szlig;t bei mir und nehmt für euer Haus, wieviel ihr bedürft, und zieht hin\\nund bringt euren jüngsten Bruder zu mir, so merke ich, da&szlig; ihr nicht Kundschafter, sondern redlich seid; dann will ich euch auch euren Bruder wiedergeben, und ihr mögt im Lande Handel treiben.\\nUnd als sie die Säcke ausschütteten, fand ein jeder seinen Beutel Geld in seinem Sack. Und als sie sahen, da&szlig; es die Beutel mit ihrem Geld waren, erschraken sie samt ihrem Vater.\\nDa sprach Jakob, ihr Vater, zu ihnen: Ihr beraubt mich meiner Kinder! Josef ist nicht mehr da, Simeon ist nicht mehr da, Benjamin wollt ihr auch wegnehmen; es geht alles über mich.\\nRuben antwortete seinem Vater und sprach: Wenn ich ihn dir nicht wiederbringe, so töte meine zwei Söhne. Gib ihn nur in meine Hand, ich will ihn dir wiederbringen.\\nEr sprach: Mein Sohn soll nicht mit euch hinabziehen; denn sein Bruder ist tot, und er ist allein übriggeblieben. Wenn ihm ein Unfall auf dem Wege begegnete, den ihr reiset, würdet ihr meine grauen Haare mit Herzeleid hinunter zu den Toten bringen. \\n</P><hr><h3>43. Kapitel</h3><h3>Zweite Reise der Söhne Jakobs nach Ägypten</h3>\\n<p>Die Hungersnot aber drückte das Land.\\nUnd als verzehrt war, was sie an Getreide aus Ägypten gebracht hatten, sprach ihr Vater zu ihnen: Zieht wieder hin und kauft uns ein wenig Getreide.\\nDa antwortete ihm Juda und sprach: Der Mann schärfte uns das hart ein und sprach: Ihr sollt mein Angesicht nicht sehen, es sei denn euer Bruder mit euch.\\nWillst du nun unsern Bruder mit uns senden, so wollen wir hinabziehen und dir zu essen kaufen.\\nWillst du ihn aber nicht senden, so ziehen wir nicht hinab. Denn der Mann hat zu uns gesagt: Ihr sollt mein Angesicht nicht sehen, euer Bruder sei denn mit euch.\\nIsrael sprach: Warum habt ihr so übel an mir getan, da&szlig; ihr dem Mann sagtet, da&szlig; ihr noch einen Bruder habt?\\nSie antworteten: Der Mann forschte so genau nach uns und unserer Verwandtschaft und sprach: Lebt euer Vater noch? Habt ihr auch noch einen Bruder? Da antworteten wir ihm, wie er uns fragte. Wie konnten wir wissen, da&szlig; er sagen würde: Bringt euren Bruder mit herab?\\nDa sprach Juda zu Israel, seinem Vater: La&szlig; den Knaben mit mir ziehen, da&szlig; wir uns aufmachen und reisen und leben und nicht sterben, wir und du und unsere Kinder.\\nIch will Bürge für ihn sein; von meinen Händen sollst du ihn fordern. Wenn ich ihn dir nicht wiederbringe und vor deine Augen stelle, so will ich mein Leben lang die Schuld tragen.\\nDenn wenn wir nicht gezögert hätten, wären wir wohl schon zweimal wiedergekommen.\\nDa sprach Israel, ihr Vater, zu ihnen: Wenn es denn so ist, wohlan so tut\\'s und nehmt von des Landes besten Früchten in eure Säcke und bringt dem Manne Geschenke hinab, ein wenig Balsam und Honig, Harz und Myrrhe, Nüsse und Mandeln.\\nNehmt auch anderes Geld mit euch, und das Geld, das ihr obenauf in euren Säcken wiederbekommen habt, bringt auch wieder hin. Vielleicht ist ein Irrtum da geschehen.\\nDazu nehmt euren Bruder, macht euch auf und geht wieder zu dem Manne.\\nAber der allmächtige Gott gebe euch Barmherzigkeit vor dem Manne, da&szlig; er mit euch ziehen lasse euren andern Bruder und Benjamin. Ich aber mu&szlig; sein wie einer, der seiner Kinder ganz und gar beraubt ist.\\nDa nahmen sie diese Geschenke und das doppelte Geld mit sich, dazu Benjamin, machten sich auf, zogen nach Ägypten und traten vor Josef.\\nAls Josef sie sah mit Benjamin, sprach er zu seinem Haushalter: Führe diese Männer ins Haus und schlachte und richte zu, denn sie sollen zu Mittag mit mir essen.\\nUnd der Mann tat, wie ihm Josef gesagt hatte, und führte die Männer in Josefs Haus.\\nSie fürchteten sich aber, weil sie in Josefs Haus geführt wurden, und sprachen: Wir sind hereingeführt um des Geldes willen, das wir in unsern Säcken das vorige Mal wiedergefunden haben; man will auf uns eindringen und über uns herfallen und uns zu Sklaven machen und uns die Esel nehmen.\\nDarum traten sie zu Josefs Haushalter und redeten mit ihm vor der Haustür\\nund sprachen: Mein Herr, wir sind das vorige Mal herabgezogen, Getreide zu kaufen,\\nund als wir in die Herberge kamen und unsere Säcke auftaten, siehe, da war eines jeden Geld oben in seinem Sack mit vollem Gewicht. Darum haben wir\\'s wieder mit uns gebracht,\\nhaben auch anderes Geld mit uns herabgebracht, Getreide zu kaufen. Wir wissen aber nicht, wer uns unser Geld in unsere Säcke gesteckt hat.\\nEr aber sprach: Seid guten Mutes, fürchtet euch nicht! Euer Gott und eures Vaters Gott hat euch einen Schatz gegeben in eure Säcke. Euer Geld habe ich erhalten. Und er führte Simeon zu ihnen heraus\\nund brachte sie in Josefs Haus, gab ihnen Wasser, da&szlig; sie ihre Fü&szlig;e wuschen, und gab ihren Eseln Futter.\\nSie aber richteten das Geschenk zu, bis Josef mittags käme; denn sie hatten gehört, da&szlig; sie dort essen sollten.\\nAls nun Josef ins Haus trat, brachten sie ihm das Geschenk ins Haus, das sie mitgebracht hatten, und fielen vor ihm nieder zur Erde.\\nEr aber grü&szlig;te sie freundlich und sprach: Geht es eurem alten Vater gut, von dem ihr mir sagtet? Lebt er noch?\\nSie antworteten: Es geht deinem Knechte, unserm Vater, gut, und er lebt noch. Und sie verneigten sich und fielen vor ihm nieder.\\nUnd er hob seine Augen auf und sah seinen Bruder Benjamin, seiner Mutter Sohn, und sprach: Ist das euer jüngster Bruder, von dem ihr mir sagtet? Und sprach weiter: Gott sei dir gnädig, mein Sohn!\\nUnd Josef eilte hinaus; denn sein Herz entbrannte ihm gegen seinen Bruder, und er suchte, wo er weinen könnte, und ging in seine Kammer und weinte daselbst.\\nUnd als er sein Angesicht gewaschen hatte, ging er heraus und hielt an sich und sprach: Legt die Speisen auf!\\nUnd man trug ihm besonders auf und jenen auch besonders und den Ägyptern, die mit ihm a&szlig;en, auch besonders. Denn die Ägypter dürfen nicht essen mit den Hebräern; denn es ist ein Greuel für sie.\\nUnd man setzte sie ihm gegenüber, den Erstgeborenen nach seiner Erstgeburt und den Jüngsten nach seiner Jugend. Darüber verwunderten sie sich untereinander.\\nUnd man trug ihnen Essen auf von seinem Tisch, aber Benjamin bekam fünfmal mehr als die andern. Und sie tranken und wurden fröhlich mit ihm. \\n</P><hr><h3>44. Kapitel</h3><h3>Josefs Brüder werden hart geängstigt</h3>\\n<p>Und Josef befahl seinem Haushalter und sprach: Fülle den Männern ihre Säcke mit Getreide, soviel sie fortbringen, und lege jedem sein Geld oben in seinen Sack.\\nUnd meinen silbernen Becher lege oben in des Jüngsten Sack mit dem Gelde für das Getreide. Der tat, wie ihm Josef gesagt hatte.\\nAm Morgen, als es licht ward, lie&szlig;en sie die Männer ziehen mit ihren Eseln.\\nAls sie aber zur Stadt hinaus waren und noch nicht weit gekommen, sprach Josef zu seinem Haushalter: Auf, jage den Männern nach, und wenn du sie ereilst, so sprich zu ihnen: Warum habt ihr Gutes mit Bösem vergolten?\\nWarum habt ihr den silbernen Becher gestohlen? Ist das nicht der, aus dem mein Herr trinkt und aus dem er wahrsagt? Ihr habt übel getan.\\nUnd als er sie ereilte, redete er mit ihnen diese Worte.\\nSie antworteten ihm: Warum redet mein Herr solche Worte? Es sei ferne von deinen Knechten, solches zu tun.\\nSiehe, das Geld, das wir fanden oben in unseren Säcken, haben wir wiedergebracht zu dir aus dem Lande Kanaan. Wie sollten wir da aus deines Herrn Hause Silber oder Gold gestohlen haben?\\nBei wem er gefunden wird unter deinen Knechten, der sei des Todes; dazu wollen auch wir meines Herrn Sklaven sein.\\nEr sprach: Ja, es sei, wie ihr geredet habt. Bei wem er gefunden wird, der sei mein Sklave, ihr aber sollt frei sein.\\nUnd sie legten eilends ein jeder seinen Sack ab auf die Erde, und ein jeder tat seinen Sack auf.\\nUnd er suchte und fing an beim Ältesten bis hin zum Jüngsten. Da fand sich der Becher in Benjamins Sack.\\nDa zerrissen sie ihre Kleider, und ein jeder belud seinen Esel, und sie zogen wieder in die Stadt.\\nUnd Juda ging mit seinen Brüdern in Josefs Haus, denn er war noch dort. Und sie fielen vor ihm nieder auf die Erde.\\nJosef aber sprach zu ihnen: Wie habt ihr das tun können? Wu&szlig;tet ihr nicht, da&szlig; ein solcher Mann, wie ich bin, wahrsagen kann?\\nJuda sprach: Was sollen wir meinem Herrn sagen, oder wie sollen wir reden, und womit können wir uns rechtfertigen? Gott hat die Missetat deiner Knechte gefunden. Siehe, wir und der, bei dem der Becher gefunden ist, sind meines Herrn Sklaven.\\nEr aber sprach: Das sei ferne von mir, solches zu tun! Der, bei dem der Becher gefunden ist, soll mein Sklave sein; ihr aber zieht hinauf mit Frieden zu eurem Vater.\\nDa trat Juda zu ihm und sprach: Mein Herr, la&szlig; deinen Knecht ein Wort reden vor den Ohren meines Herrn, und dein Zorn entbrenne nicht über deinen Knecht, denn du bist wie der Pharao.\\nMein Herr fragte seine Knechte und sprach: Habt ihr noch einen Vater oder Bruder?a\\nDa antworteten wir: Wir haben einen Vater, der ist alt, und einen jungen Knaben, in seinem Alter geboren, und sein Bruder ist tot, und er ist allein übriggeblieben von seiner Mutter, und sein Vater hat ihn lieb.\\nDa sprachst du zu deinen Knechten: Bringt ihn herab zu mir, ich will ihm Gnade erweisen.\\nWir aber antworteten meinem Herrn: Der Knabe kann seinen Vater nicht verlassen; wenn er ihn verlie&szlig;e, würde der sterben.\\nDa sprachst du zu deinen Knechten: Wenn euer jüngster Bruder nicht mit euch herkommt, sollt ihr mein Angesicht nicht mehr sehen.\\nDa zogen wir hinauf zu deinem Knecht, meinem Vater, und sagten ihm meines Herrn Rede.\\nDa sprach unser Vater: Zieht wieder hin und kauft uns ein wenig Getreide.\\nWir aber sprachen: Wir können nicht hinabziehen; nur wenn unser jüngster Bruder mit uns ist, wollen wir hinabziehen; denn wir dürfen des Mannes Angesicht nicht sehen, wenn unser jüngster Bruder nicht mit uns ist.\\nDa sprach dein Knecht, mein Vater, zu uns: Ihr wi&szlig;t, da&szlig; mir meine Frau zwei Söhne geboren hat;\\neiner ging von mir, und ich mu&szlig;te mir sagen: Er ist zerrissen. Und ich hab ihn nicht gesehen bisher.\\nWerdet ihr diesen auch von mir nehmen und widerfährt ihm ein Unfall, so werdet ihr meine grauen Haare mit Jammer hinunter zu den Toten bringen.\\nNun, wenn ich heimkäme zu deinem Knecht, meinem Vater, und der Knabe wäre nicht mit uns, an dem er mit ganzer Seele hängt,\\nso wird\\'s geschehen, da&szlig; er stirbt, wenn er sieht, da&szlig; der Knabe nicht da ist. So würden wir, deine Knechte, die grauen Haare deines Knechtes, unseres Vaters, mit Herzeleid hinunter zu den Toten bringen.\\nDenn ich, dein Knecht, bin Bürge geworden für den Knaben vor meinem Vater und sprach: Bringe ich ihn dir nicht wieder, so will ich mein Leben lang die Schuld tragen.\\nDarum la&szlig; deinen Knecht hier bleiben an des Knaben Statt als Sklaven meines Herrn und den Knaben mit seinen Brüdern hinaufziehen.\\nDenn wie soll ich hinaufziehen zu meinem Vater, wenn der Knabe nicht mit mir ist? Ich könnte den Jammer nicht sehen, der über meinen Vater kommen würde. \\n</P><hr><h3>45.

Danach redeten seine Brüder mit ihm.\\nUnd als das Gerücht kam in des Pharao Haus, da&szlig; Josefs Brüder gekommen wären, gefiel es dem Pharao gut und allen seinen Gro&szlig;en.\\nUnd der Pharao sprach zu Josef: Sage deinen Brüdern: Macht es so: Beladet eure Tiere, ziehet hin!\\nUnd wenn ihr ins Land Kanaan kommt, so nehmt euren Vater und alle die Euren und kommt zu mir; ich will euch das Beste geben in Ägyptenland, da&szlig; ihr essen sollt das Fett des Landes.\\nUnd gebiete ihnen: Macht es so: Nehmt mit euch aus Ägyptenland Wagen für eure Kinder und Frauen und bringt euren Vater mit und kommt.\\nUnd seht euren Hausrat nicht an; denn das Beste des ganzen Landes Ägypten soll euer sein.\\nDie Söhne Israels taten so. Und Josef gab ihnen Wagen nach dem Befehl des Pharao und Zehrung auf den Weg\\nund gab ihnen allen, einem jeden ein Feierkleid, aber Benjamin gab er dreihundert Silberstücke und fünf Feierkleider.\\nUnd seinem Vater sandte er zehn Esel, mit dem Besten aus Ägypten beladen, und zehn Eselinnen mit Getreide und Brot und mit Zehrung für seinen Vater auf den Weg.\\nDamit entlie&szlig; er seine Brüder, und sie zogen hin.

Der erstgeborene Sohn Jakobs: Ruben.\\nDie Söhne Rubens: Henoch, Pallu, Hezron und Karmi.\\nDie Söhne Simeons: Jemuël, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar und Schaul, der Sohn der Kanaaniterin.\\nDie Söhne Levis: Gerschon, Kehat und Merari.\\nDie Söhne Judas: Er, Onan, Schela, Perez und Serach. Aber Er und Onan waren gestorben im Lande Kanaan. Die Söhne aber des Perez: Hezron und Hamul.\\nDie Söhne Issachars: Tola, Puwa, Jaschub und Schimron.\\nDie Söhne Sebulons: Sered, Elon und Jachleel.\\nDas sind die Söhne der Lea, die sie Jakob gebar in Mesopotamien, dazu seine Tochter Dina. Die machen zusammen mit ihren Söhnen und Töchtern dreiunddrei&szlig;ig Seelen.\\nDie Söhne Gads: Zifjon, Haggi, Schuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arod und Areli.\\nDie Söhne Assers: Jimna, Jischwa, Jischwi, Beri, dazu Serach, ihre Schwester; und die Söhne Berias: Heber und Malkïl.\\nDas sind die Söhne der Silpa, die Laban seiner Tochter Lea gegeben hatte, und sie gebar Jakob diese sechzehn Seelen.\\nDie Söhne Rahels, der Frau Jakobs: Josef und Benjamin.\\nUnd dem Josef wurden geboren in Ägyptenland Manasse und Ephraim, die ihm Asenat gebar, die Tochter Potiferas, des Priesters zu On.\\nDie Söhne Benjamins: Bela, Becher, Aschbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosch, Muppim, Huppim und Ard.\\nDas sind die Söhne der Rahel, die Jakob geboren wurden, zusammen vierzehn Seelen.\\nDer Sohn Dans: Schuham.\\nDie Söhne Naftalis: Jachzeel, Guni, Jezer und Schillem.\\nDas sind die Söhne der Bilha, die Laban seiner Tochter Rahel gegeben hatte, und sie gebar Jakob diese sieben Seelen.\\nAlle Seelen, die mit Jakob nach Ägypten kamen, seine Nachkommen - ausgenommen die Frauen seiner Söhne - sind alle zusammen sechsundsechzig Seelen.\\nDie Söhne Josefs, die in Ägypten geboren sind, waren zwei Seelen; so da&szlig; alle Seelen des Hauses Jakobs, die nach Ägypten kamen, waren siebzig.\\n[Note: Jakobs Wiedersehen mit Josef]Und Jakob sandte Juda vor sich her zu Josef, da&szlig; dieser ihm Goschen anwiese. Als sie in das Land Goschen kamen,\\nspannte Josef seinen Wagen an und zog hinauf seinem Vater Israel entgegen nach Goschen. Und als er ihn sah, fiel er ihm um den Hals und weinte lange an seinem Halse.\\nDa sprach Israel zu Josef: Ich will nun gerne sterben, nachdem ich dein Angesicht gesehen habe, da&szlig; du noch lebst.\\nJosef sprach zu seinen Brüdern und zu seines Vaters Hause: Ich will hinaufziehen und dem Pharao ansagen und zu ihm sprechen: Meine Brüder und meines Vaters Haus sind zu mir gekommen aus dem Lande Kanaan\\nund sind Viehhirten, denn es sind Leute, die Vieh haben; ihr Kleinvieh und Gro&szlig;vieh und alles, was sie haben, haben sie mitgebracht.\\nWenn euch nun der Pharao wird rufen und sagen: Was ist euer Gewerbe?\\nso sollt ihr sagen: Deine Knechte sind Leute, die Vieh haben, von unserer Jugend an bis jetzt, wir und unsere Väter-, damit ihr wohnen dürft im Lande Goschen. Denn alle Viehhirten sind den Ägyptern ein Greuel. \\n</P><hr><h3>47. Kapitel</h3><h3>Jakob vor dem Pharao</h3>\\n<p>Da kam Josef und sagte es dem Pharao an und sprach: Mein Vater und meine Brüder, ihr Kleinvieh und Gro&szlig;vieh und alles, was sie haben, sind gekommen aus dem Lande Kanaan, und siehe, sie sind im Lande Goschen.\\nUnd er nahm von allen seinen Brüdern fünf und stellte sie vor den Pharao.\\nDa sprach der Pharao zu seinen Brüdern: Was ist euer Gewerbe? Sie antworteten: Deine Knechte sind Viehhirten, wir und unsere Väter.\\nUnd sagten weiter zum Pharao: Wir sind gekommen, bei euch zu wohnen im Lande; denn deine Knechte haben nicht Weide für ihr Vieh, so hart drückt die Hungersnot das Land Kanaan. So la&szlig; doch nun deine Knechte im Land Goschen wohnen.\\nDer Pharao sprach zu Josef: Es ist dein Vater, und es sind deine Brüder, die zu dir gekommen sind.\\nDas Land Ägypten steht dir offen, la&szlig; sie am besten Ort des Landes wohnen, la&szlig; sie im Lande Goschen wohnen, und wenn du wei&szlig;t, da&szlig; Leute unter ihnen sind, die tüchtig sind, so setze sie über mein Vieh.\\nJosef brachte auch seinen Vater Jakob hinein und stellte ihn vor den Pharao. Und Jakob segnete den Pharao.\\nDer Pharao aber fragte Jakob: Wie alt bist du?\\nJakob sprach zum Pharao: Die Zeit meiner Wanderschaft ist hundertunddrei&szlig;ig Jahre; wenig und böse ist die Zeit meines Lebens und reicht nicht heran an die Zeit meiner Väter in ihrer Wanderschaft.\\nUnd Jakob segnete den Pharao und ging hinaus von ihm.\\nAber Josef lie&szlig; seinen Vater und seine Brüder in Ägyptenland wohnen und gab ihnen Besitz am besten Ort des Landes, im Lande Ramses, wie der Pharao geboten hatte.\\nUnd er versorgte seinen Vater und seine Brüder und das ganze Haus seines Vaters mit Brot, einen jeden nach der Zahl seiner Kinder.\\n[Note: Die Ägypter verkaufen ihre Habe und sich selbst dem Pharao]Es war aber kein Brot im ganzen Lande; denn die Hungersnot war sehr schwer, so da&szlig; Ägypten und Kanaan verschmachteten vor Hunger.\\nUnd Josef brachte alles Geld zusammen, das in Ägypten und Kanaan gefunden wurde, für das Getreide, das sie kauften; und er tat alles Geld in das Haus des Pharao.\\nAls es nun an Geld gebrach im Lande Ägypten und in Kanaan, kamen alle Ägypter zu Josef und sprachen: Schaffe uns Brot! Warum lä&szlig;t du uns vor dir sterben, nun wir ohne Geld sind?\\nJosef sprach: Schafft euer Vieh her, so will ich euch Brot als Entgelt für das Vieh geben, weil ihr ohne Geld seid.\\nDa brachten sie Josef ihr Vieh, und er gab ihnen Brot als Entgelt für ihre Pferde, Schafe, Rinder und Esel. So ernährte er sie mit Brot das Jahr hindurch für all ihr Vieh.\\nAls das Jahr um war, kamen sie zu ihm im zweiten Jahr und sprachen zu ihm: Wir wollen unserm Herrn nicht verbergen, da&szlig; nicht allein das Geld, sondern auch alles Vieh dahin ist an unsern Herrn, und ist nichts mehr übrig vor unserm Herrn als nur unsere Leiber und unser Feld.\\nWarum lä&szlig;t du uns vor dir sterben und unser Feld? Kaufe uns und unser Land für Brot, da&szlig; wir und unser Land leibeigen seien dem Pharao; gib uns Korn zur Saat, da&szlig; wir leben und nicht sterben und das Feld nicht wüst werde.\\nSo kaufte Josef dem Pharao das ganze Ägypten. Denn die Ägypter verkauften ein jeder seinen Acker, weil die Hungersnot schwer auf ihnen lag. Und so wurde das Land dem Pharao zu eigen.\\nUnd er machte das Volk leibeigen von einem Ende Ägyptens bis ans andere.\\nAusgenommen das Feld der Priester, das kaufte er nicht; denn es war vom Pharao für die Priester verordnet, da&szlig; sie sich nähren sollten von dem Landanteil, den er ihnen gegeben hatte. Darum durften sie ihr Feld nicht verkaufen.\\nDa sprach Josef zu dem Volk: Siehe, ich hab heute euch und euer Feld für den Pharao gekauft; siehe, da habt ihr Korn zur Saat, und nun besäet das Feld.\\nUnd von dem Getreide sollt ihr den Fünften dem Pharao geben; vier Teile sollen euer sein, das Feld zu besäen und zu eurer Speise und für euer Haus und eure Kinder.\\nSie sprachen: Du hast uns beim Leben erhalten; la&szlig; uns nur Gnade finden vor dir, unserm Herrn, dann wollen wir dem Pharao leibeigen sein.\\nSo machte es Josef zum Gesetz bis auf diesen Tag, den Fünften vom Feld der Ägypter dem Pharao zu geben; ausgenommen blieb das Feld der Priester, das wurde nicht dem Pharao zu eigen.\\n[Note: Jakobs letzter Wunsch]So wohnte Israel in Ägypten im Lande Goschen, und sie hatten es inne und wuchsen und mehrten sich sehr.\\nUnd Jakob lebte siebzehn Jahre in Ägyptenland, da&szlig; sein ganzes Alter wurde hundertundsiebenundvierzig Jahre.\\nAls nun die Zeit herbeikam, da&szlig; Israel sterben sollte, rief er seinen Sohn Josef und sprach zu ihm: Hab ich Gnade vor dir gefunden, so lege deine Hand unter meine Hüfte, da&szlig; du die Liebe und Treue an mir tust und begrabest mich nicht inÄgypten,\\nsondern ich will liegen bei meinen Vätern, und du sollst mich aus Ägypten führen und in ihrem Grab begraben. Er sprach: Ich will tun, wie du gesagt hast.\\nEr aber sprach: So schwöre mir. Und er schwor ihm. Da neigte sich Israel anbetend über das Kopfende des Bettes hin. \\n</P><hr><h3>48.

Und er nahm mit sich seine beiden Söhne Manasse und Ephraim.\\nDa wurde Jakob angesagt: Siehe, dein Sohn Josef kommt zu dir.

Er sprach: Bringe sie her zu mir, da&szlig; ich sie segne.\\nDenn die Augen Israels waren schwach geworden vor Alter, und er konnte nicht mehr sehen. Und Josef brachte sie zu ihm. Er aber kü&szlig;te sie und herzte sie\\nund sprach zu Josef: Siehe, ich habe dein Angesicht gesehen, was ich nicht gedacht hätte, und siehe, Gott hat mich auch deine Söhne sehen lassen.\\nUnd Josef nahm sie von seinem Scho&szlig; und verneigte sich vor ihm zur Erde.\\nDann nahm sie Josef beide, Ephraim an seine rechte Hand gegenüber Israels linker Hand und Manasse an seine linke Hand gegenüber Israels rechter Hand, und brachte sie zu ihm.\\nAber Israel streckte seine rechte Hand aus und legte sie auf Ephraims, des Jüngeren, Haupt und seine linke auf Manasses Haupt und kreuzte seine Arme, obwohl Manasse der Erstgeborene war.\\nUnd er segnete Josef und sprach: Der Gott, vor dem meine Väter Abraham und Isaak gewandelt sind, der Gott, der mein Hirte gewesen ist mein Leben lang bis auf diesen Tag,\\nder Engel, der mich erlöst hat von allem Übel, der segne die Knaben, da&szlig; durch sie mein und meiner Väter Abraham und Isaak Name fortlebe, da&szlig; sie wachsen und viel werden auf Erden.\\nAls aber Josef sah, da&szlig; sein Vater die rechte Hand auf Ephraims Haupt legte, mi&szlig;fiel es ihm, und er fa&szlig;te seines Vaters Hand, da&szlig; er sie von Ephraims Haupt auf Manasses Haupt wendete,\\nund sprach zu ihm: Nicht so, mein Vater, dieser ist der Erstgeborene; lege deine rechte Hand auf sein Haupt.\\nAber sein Vater weigerte sich und sprach: Ich wei&szlig; wohl, mein Sohn, ich wei&szlig; wohl. Dieser soll auch ein Volk werden und wird gro&szlig; sein, aber sein jüngerer Bruder wird grö&szlig;er als er werden, und sein Geschlecht wird eine Menge von Völkern werden.\\nSo segnete er sie an jenem Tage und sprach: Wer in Israel jemanden segnen will, der sage: Gott mache dich wie Ephraim und Manasse! Und so setzte er Ephraim vor Manasse.\\nUnd Israel sprach zu Josef: Siehe, ich sterbe; aber Gott wird mit euch sein und wird euch zurückbringen in das Land eurer Väter.\\nIch gebe dir ein Stück Land vor deinen Brüdern, das ich mit meinem Schwert und Bogen aus der Hand der Amoriter genommen habe. \\n</P><hr><h3>49.

Nun vergib doch diese Missetat uns, den Dienern des Gottes deines Vaters!

E esta disse à mulher: É assim que Deus disse: Não comereis de toda árvore do jardim?\\nE disse a mulher à serpente: Do fruto das árvores do jardim comeremos,\\nmas, do fruto da árvore que está no meio do jardim, disse Deus: Não comereis dele, nem nele tocareis, para que não morrais.\\nEntão, a serpente disse à mulher: Certamente não morrereis.\\nPorque Deus sabe que, no dia em que dele comerdes, se abrirão os vossos olhos, e sereis como Deus, sabendo o bem e o mal.\\nE, vendo a mulher que aquela árvore {era} boa para se comer, e agradável aos olhos, e árvore desejável para dar entendimento, tomou do seu fruto, e comeu, e deu também a seu marido, e {ele} comeu com ela.\\nEntão, foram abertos os olhos de ambos, e conheceram que {estavam} nus; e coseram folhas de figueira, e fizeram para si aventais. {ou cintas}\\nE ouviram a voz do SENHOR Deus, que passeava no jardim pela viração do dia; e escondeu-se Adão e sua mulher da presença do SENHOR Deus, entre as árvores do jardim.\\nE chamou o SENHOR Deus a Adão e disse-lhe: Onde estás?\\nE ele disse: Ouvi a tua voz soar no jardim, e temi, porque estava nu, e escondi-me.\\nE Deus disse: Quem te mostrou que estavas nu? Comeste tu da árvore de que te ordenei que não comesses?\\nEntão, disse Adão: A mulher que me deste por companheira, ela me deu da árvore, e comi.\\nE disse o SENHOR Deus à mulher: Por que fizeste isso? E disse a mulher: A serpente me enganou, e eu comi.\\nEntão, o SENHOR Deus disse à serpente: Porquanto fizeste isso, maldita {serás} mais que toda besta e mais que todos os animais do campo; sobre o teu ventre andarás e pó comerás todos os dias da tua vida.\\nE porei inimizade entre ti e a mulher e entre a tua semente e a sua semente; esta {Heb. ele} te ferirá a cabeça, e tu lhe ferirás o calcanhar.\\nE à mulher disse: Multiplicarei grandemente a tua dor e a tua conceição; com dor terás filhos; e o teu desejo será para o teu marido, e ele te dominará.\\nE a Adão disse: Porquanto deste ouvidos à voz de tua mulher e comeste da árvore de que te ordenei, dizendo: Não comerás dela, maldita {é} a terra por causa de ti; com dor comerás dela todos os dias da tua vida.\\nEspinhos e cardos também te produzirá; e comerás a erva do campo.\\nNo suor do teu rosto, comerás o teu pão, até que te tornes à terra; porque dela foste tomado, porquanto és pó e em pó te tornarás.\\nE chamou Adão o nome de sua mulher Eva, {que significa vida ou mãe da vida} porquanto ela era a mãe de todos os viventes.\\nE fez o SENHOR Deus a Adão e a sua mulher túnicas de peles e os vestiu.\\nEntão, disse o SENHOR Deus: Eis que o homem é como um de nós, sabendo o bem e o mal; ora, pois, para que não estenda a sua mão, e tome também da árvore da vida, e coma, e viva eternamente,\\no SENHOR Deus, pois, o lançou fora do jardim do Éden, para lavrar a terra, de que fora tomado.\\nE, havendo lançado fora o homem, pôs querubins ao oriente do jardim do Éden e uma espada inflamada que andava ao redor, para guardar o caminho da árvore da vida.\\nE conheceu Adão a Eva, sua mulher, e ela concebeu, e teve a Caim, {que significa aquisição} e disse: Alcancei do SENHOR um varão.\\nE teve mais a seu irmão Abel; {que significa vaidade} e Abel foi pastor de ovelhas, e Caim foi lavrador da terra.\\nE aconteceu, ao cabo de dias, que Caim trouxe do fruto da terra uma oferta ao SENHOR.\\nE Abel também trouxe dos primogênitos das suas ovelhas e da sua gordura; e atentou o SENHOR para Abel e para a sua oferta.\\nMas para Caim e para a sua oferta não atentou. E irou-se Caim fortemente, e descaiu-lhe o seu semblante.\\nE o SENHOR disse a Caim: Por que te iraste? E por que descaiu o teu semblante?\\nSe bem fizeres, não haverá aceitação {ou remissão} para ti? E, se não fizeres bem, o pecado jaz à porta, e para ti será o seu desejo, e sobre ele dominarás.\\nE falou Caim com o seu irmão Abel; e sucedeu que, estando eles no campo, se levantou Caim contra o seu irmão Abel e o matou.\\nE disse o SENHOR a Caim: Onde está Abel, teu irmão? E ele disse: Não sei; sou eu guardador do meu irmão?\\nE disse Deus: Que fizeste? A voz do sangue do teu irmão clama a mim desde a terra.\\nE agora maldito {és} tu desde a terra, que abriu a sua boca para receber da tua mão o sangue do teu irmão.\\nQuando lavrares a terra, não te dará mais a sua força; fugitivo e errante serás na terra.\\nEntão, disse Caim ao SENHOR: É maior a minha maldade que a que possa ser {ou suportar} perdoada.\\nEis que hoje me lanças da face da terra, e da tua face me esconderei; e serei fugitivo e errante na terra, e será que todo aquele que me achar me matará.\\nO SENHOR, porém, disse-lhe: Portanto, qualquer que matar a Caim sete vezes será castigado. {ou vingado} E pôs o SENHOR um sinal em Caim, para que não o ferisse qualquer que o achasse.\\nE saiu Caim de diante da face do SENHOR e habitou na terra de Node, da banda do oriente do Éden.\\nE conheceu Caim a sua mulher, e ela concebeu e teve a Enoque; e ele edificou uma cidade e chamou o nome da cidade pelo nome de seu filho Enoque.\\nE a Enoque nasceu Irade, e Irade gerou a Meujael, e Meujael gerou a Metusael, e Metusael gerou a Lameque.\\nE tomou Lameque para si duas mulheres; o nome de uma era Ada, e o nome da outra, Zilá.\\nE Ada teve a Jabal; este foi o pai dos que habitam em tendas e {têm} gado.\\nE o nome do seu irmão era Jubal; este foi o pai de todos os que tocam harpa e órgão.\\nE Zilá também teve a Tubalcaim, mestre de toda obra de cobre e de ferro; e a irmã de Tubalcaim {foi} Naamá.\\nE disse Lameque a suas mulheres: Ada e Zilá, ouvi a minha voz; vós, mulheres de Lameque, escutai o meu dito: porque eu matei um varão, por me ferir, e um jovem, por me pisar.\\nPorque sete vezes Caim será vingado; {ou castigado} mas Lameque, setenta vezes sete.\\nE tornou Adão a conhecer a sua mulher; e ela teve um filho e chamou o seu nome Sete; {que significa compensação ou renovo} porque, disse ela, Deus me deu outra semente em lugar de Abel; porquanto Caim o matou.\\nE a Sete mesmo também nasceu um filho; e chamou o seu nome Enos; então, se começou a invocar o nome do SENHOR.\\nEste é o livro das gerações de Adão. No dia em que Deus criou o homem, à semelhança de Deus o fez.\\nMacho e fêmea os criou, e os abençoou, e chamou o seu nome Adão, no dia em que foram criados.\\nE Adão viveu cento e trinta anos, e gerou um {filho} à sua semelhança, conforme a sua imagem, e chamou o seu nome Sete.\\nE foram os dias de Adão, depois que gerou a Sete, oitocentos anos, e gerou filhos e filhas.\\nE foram todos os dias que Adão viveu novecentos e trinta anos; e morreu.\\nE viveu Sete cento e cinco anos e gerou a Enos.\\nE viveu Sete, depois que gerou a Enos, oitocentos e sete anos e gerou filhos e filhas.\\nE foram todos os dias de Sete novecentos e doze anos; e morreu.\\nE viveu Enos noventa anos; e gerou a Cainã.\\nE viveu Enos, depois que gerou a Cainã, oitocentos e quinze anos e gerou filhos e filhas.\\nE foram todos os dias de Enos novecentos e cinco anos; e morreu.\\nE viveu Cainã setenta anos e gerou a Maalalel.\\nE viveu Cainã, depois que gerou a Maalalel, oitocentos e quarenta anos e gerou filhos e filhas.\\nE foram todos os dias de Cainã novecentos e dez anos; e morreu.\\nE viveu Maalalel sessenta e cinco anos e gerou a Jarede.\\nE viveu Maalalel, depois que gerou a Jarede, oitocentos e trinta anos e gerou filhos e filhas.\\nE foram todos os dias de Maalalel oitocentos e noventa e cinco anos; e morreu.\\nE viveu Jarede cento e sessenta e dois anos e gerou a Enoque.\\nE viveu Jarede, depois que gerou a Enoque, oitocentos anos e gerou filhos e filhas.\\nE foram todos os dias de Jarede novecentos e sessenta e dois anos; e morreu.\\nE viveu Enoque sessenta e cinco anos e gerou a Metusalém.\\nE andou Enoque com Deus, depois que gerou a Metusalém, trezentos anos e gerou filhos e filhas.\\nE foram todos os dias de Enoque trezentos e sessenta e cinco anos.\\nE andou Enoque com Deus; e não se viu {mais,} porquanto Deus {para si} o tomou.\\nE viveu Metusalém cento e oitenta e sete anos e gerou a Lameque.\\nE viveu Metusalém, depois que gerou a Lameque, setecentos e oitenta e dois anos e gerou filhos e filhas.\\nE foram todos os dias de Metusalém novecentos e sessenta e nove anos; e morreu.\\nE viveu Lameque cento e oitenta e dois anos e gerou um filho.\\nE chamou o seu nome Noé, {Heb. Noah, que significa repouso} dizendo: Este nos consolará acerca de nossas obras e do trabalho de nossas mãos, por causa da terra que o SENHOR amaldiçoou.\\nE viveu Lameque, depois que gerou a Noé, quinhentos e noventa e cinco anos e gerou filhos e filhas.\\nE foram todos os dias de Lameque setecentos e setenta e sete anos; e morreu.\\nE era Noé da idade de quinhentos anos e gerou Noé a Sem, Cam e Jafé.\\nE aconteceu que, como os homens começaram a multiplicar-se sobre a face da terra, e lhes nasceram filhas,\\nviram os filhos de Deus que as filhas dos homens eram formosas; e tomaram para si mulheres de todas as que escolheram.\\nEntão, disse o SENHOR: Não contenderá {ou permanecerá} o meu Espírito para sempre com o homem, porque ele também {é} carne; porém os seus dias serão cento e vinte anos.\\nHavia, naqueles dias, gigantes na terra; e também depois, quando os filhos de Deus entraram às filhas dos homens e {delas} geraram {filhos;} estes {eram} os valentes que houve na antiguidade, os varões de fama.\\nE viu o SENHOR que a maldade do homem se multiplicara sobre a terra e que toda imaginação dos pensamentos de seu coração era só má continuamente.\\nEntão, arrependeu-se o SENHOR de haver feito o homem sobre a terra, e pesou-lhe em seu coração.\\nE disse o SENHOR: Destruirei, de sobre a face da terra, o homem que criei, desde o homem até ao animal, até ao réptil e até à ave dos céus; porque me arrependo de os haver feito.\\nNoé, porém, achou graça aos olhos do SENHOR.\\nEstas {são} as gerações de Noé: Noé era varão justo e reto em suas gerações; Noé andava com Deus.\\nE gerou Noé três filhos: Sem, Cam e Jafé.\\nA terra, porém, estava corrompida diante da face de Deus; e encheu-se a terra de violência.\\nE viu Deus a terra, e eis que estava corrompida; porque toda carne havia corrompido o seu caminho sobre a terra.\\nEntão, disse Deus a Noé: O fim de toda carne é vindo perante a minha face; porque a terra está cheia de violência; e eis que os desfarei com a terra.\\nFaze para ti uma arca da madeira de gofer; farás compartimentos {ou divisões} na arca e a betumarás por dentro e por fora com betume.\\nE desta maneira farás: de trezentos côvados o comprimento da arca, e de cinqüenta côvados a sua largura, e de trinta côvados a sua altura.\\nFarás na arca uma janela e de um côvado a acabarás em cima; e a porta da arca porás ao seu lado; far-lhe-ás {andares} baixos, segundos e terceiros.\\nPorque eis que eu trago um dilúvio de águas sobre a terra, para desfazer toda carne em que {há} espírito de vida debaixo dos céus: tudo o que há na terra expirará.\\nMas contigo estabelecerei o meu pacto; e entrarás na arca, tu e os teus filhos, e a tua mulher, e as mulheres de teus filhos contigo.\\nE de tudo o que vive, de toda carne, dois de cada espécie meterás na arca, para os conservares vivos contigo; macho e fêmea serão.\\nDas aves conforme a sua espécie, dos animais conforme a sua espécie, de todo réptil da terra conforme a sua espécie, dois de cada {espécie} virão a ti, para os conservares em vida.\\nE tu toma para ti de toda comida que se come e ajunta-a para ti; e te será para mantimento, para ti e para eles.\\nAssim fez Noé; conforme tudo o que Deus lhe mandou, assim o fez.\\nDepois, disse o SENHOR a Noé: Entra tu e toda a tua casa na arca, porque te hei visto justo diante de mim nesta geração.\\nDe todo animal limpo tomarás para ti sete {e} sete: o macho e sua fêmea; mas dos animais que não são limpos, dois: o macho e sua fêmea.\\nTambém das aves dos céus sete {e} sete: macho e fêmea, para se conservar em vida a semente sobre a face de toda a terra.\\nPorque, passados ainda sete dias, farei chover sobre a terra quarenta dias e quarenta noites; e desfarei de sobre a face da terra toda substância que fiz.\\nE fez Noé conforme tudo o que o SENHOR lhe ordenara.\\nE {era} Noé da idade de seiscentos anos, quando o dilúvio das águas veio sobre a terra.\\nE entrou Noé, e seus filhos, e sua mulher, e as mulheres de seus filhos com ele na arca, por causa das águas do dilúvio.\\nDos animais limpos, e dos animais que não {são} limpos, e das aves, e de todo o réptil sobre a terra,\\nentraram de dois em dois para Noé na arca, macho e fêmea, como Deus ordenara a Noé.\\nE aconteceu que, passados sete dias, vieram sobre a terra as águas do dilúvio.\\nNo ano seiscentos da vida de Noé, no mês segundo, aos dezessete dias do mês, naquele mesmo dia, se romperam todas as fontes do grande abismo, e as janelas dos céus se abriram,\\ne houve chuva sobre a terra quarenta dias e quarenta noites.\\nE, no mesmo dia, entrou Noé, e Sem, e Cam, e Jafé, os filhos de Noé, como também a mulher de Noé, e as três mulheres de seus filhos, com ele na arca;\\neles, e todo animal conforme a sua espécie, e todo gado conforme a sua espécie, e todo réptil que se roja sobre a terra conforme a sua espécie, e toda ave conforme a sua espécie, todo pássaro de toda {ou toda sorte de asas} qualidade.\\nE de toda carne, em que havia espírito de vida, entraram de dois em dois para Noé na arca.\\nE os que entraram, macho e fêmea de toda carne entraram, como Deus lhe tinha ordenado; e o SENHOR a fechou por fora.\\nE esteve o dilúvio quarenta dias sobre a terra; e cresceram as águas e levantaram a arca, e ela se elevou sobre a terra.\\nE prevaleceram as águas e cresceram grandemente sobre a terra; e a arca andava sobre as águas.\\nE as águas prevaleceram excessivamente sobre a terra; e todos os altos montes que {havia} debaixo de todo o céu foram cobertos.\\nQuinze côvados acima prevaleceram as águas; e os montes foram cobertos.\\nE expirou toda carne que se movia sobre a terra, tanto de ave como de gado, e de feras, e de todo o réptil que se roja sobre a terra, e de todo homem.\\nTudo o que {tinha} fôlego de espírito de vida em seus narizes, tudo o que {havia} no seco, morreu.\\nAssim, foi desfeita toda substância que {havia} sobre a face da terra, desde o homem até ao animal, até ao réptil e até à ave dos céus; e foram extintos da terra; e ficou somente Noé e os que com ele {estavam} na arca.\\nE prevaleceram as águas sobre a terra cento e cinqüenta dias.\\nE lembrou-se Deus de Noé, e de todo animal, e de toda rês que com ele {estava} na arca; e Deus fez passar um vento sobre a terra, e aquietaram-se as águas.\\nCerraram-se também as fontes do abismo e as janelas dos céus, e a chuva dos céus deteve-se.\\nE as águas tornaram de sobre a terra continuamente {Heb. indo e tornando} e, ao cabo de cento e cinqüenta dias, as águas minguaram.\\nE a arca repousou, no sétimo mês, no dia dezessete do mês, sobre os montes de Ararate.\\nE foram as águas indo e minguando até ao décimo mês; no décimo mês, no primeiro dia do mês, apareceram os cumes dos montes.\\nE aconteceu que, ao cabo de quarenta dias, abriu Noé a janela da arca que tinha feito.\\nE soltou um corvo, que saiu, indo e voltando, até que as águas se secaram de sobre a terra.\\nDepois, soltou uma pomba, a ver se as águas tinham minguado de sobre a face da terra.\\nA pomba, porém, não achou repouso para a planta de seu pé e voltou a ele para a arca; porque as águas {estavam} sobre a face de toda a terra; e ele estendeu a sua mão, e tomou-a, e meteu-a consigo na arca.\\nE esperou ainda outros sete dias e tornou a enviar a pomba fora da arca.\\nE a pomba voltou a ele sobre a tarde; e eis, arrancada, uma folha de oliveira no seu bico; e conheceu Noé que as águas tinham minguado sobre a terra.\\nEntão, esperou ainda outros sete dias e enviou fora a pomba; mas não tornou mais a ele.\\nE aconteceu {que,} no ano seiscentos e um, no {mês} primeiro, no primeiro {dia} do mês, as águas se secaram de sobre a terra. Então, Noé tirou a cobertura da arca e olhou, e eis que a face da terra estava enxuta.\\nE, no segundo mês, aos vinte e sete dias do mês, a terra estava seca.\\nEntão, falou Deus a Noé, dizendo:\\nSai da arca tu, e tua mulher, e teus filhos, e as mulheres de teus filhos contigo.\\nTodo animal que {está} contigo, de toda carne, de ave, e de gado, e de todo réptil que se roja sobre a terra, traze fora contigo; e povoem abundantemente a terra, e frutifiquem, e se multipliquem sobre a terra.\\nEntão, saiu Noé, e seus filhos, e sua mulher, e as mulheres de seus filhos com ele;\\ntodo animal, todo réptil, toda ave, tudo o que se move sobre a terra, conforme as suas famílias, saiu para fora da arca.\\nE edificou Noé um altar ao SENHOR; e tomou de todo animal limpo e de toda ave limpa e ofereceu holocaustos sobre o altar.\\nE o SENHOR cheirou o suave cheiro e disse o SENHOR em seu coração: Não tornarei mais a amaldiçoar a terra por causa do homem, porque a imaginação do coração do homem {é} má desde a sua meninice; nem tornarei mais a ferir todo vivente, como fiz.\\nEnquanto a terra durar, sementeira e sega, e frio e calor, e verão e inverno, e dia e noite não cessarão.\\nE abençoou Deus a Noé e a seus filhos e disse-lhes: frutificai, e multiplicai-vos, e enchei a terra.\\nE será o vosso temor e o vosso pavor sobre todo animal da terra e sobre toda ave dos céus; tudo o que se move sobre a terra e todos os peixes do mar na vossa mão são entregues.\\nTudo quanto se move, que é vivente, será para vosso mantimento; tudo vos tenho dado, como a erva verde.\\nA carne, porém, com sua vida, isto é, com seu sangue, não comereis.\\nE certamente requererei o vosso sangue, {o sangue} da vossa vida; {ou alma} da mão de todo animal o requererei, como também da mão do homem e da mão do irmão de cada um requererei a vida do homem.\\nQuem derramar o sangue do homem, pelo homem o seu sangue será derramado; porque Deus fez o homem conforme a {sua} imagem.\\nMas vós, frutificai e multiplicai-vos; povoai abundantemente a terra e multiplicai-vos nela.\\nE falou Deus a Noé e a seus filhos com ele, dizendo:\\nE eu, eis que estabeleço o meu concerto convosco, e com a vossa semente depois de vós,\\ne com toda alma {ou criatura} vivente, que convosco está, de aves, de reses, e de todo animal da terra convosco; desde todos que saíram da arca, até todo animal da terra.\\nE eu convosco estabeleço o meu concerto, que não será mais destruída toda carne pelas águas do dilúvio e que não haverá mais dilúvio para destruir a terra.\\nE disse Deus: Este {é} o sinal do concerto que ponho entre mim e vós e entre toda alma vivente, que está convosco, por gerações eternas.\\nO meu arco tenho posto na nuvem; este será por sinal do concerto entre mim e a terra.\\nE acontecerá que, quando eu trouxer nuvens sobre a terra, aparecerá o arco nas nuvens.\\nEntão, me lembrarei do meu concerto, que está entre mim e vós e ainda toda alma vivente de toda carne; e as águas não se tornarão mais em dilúvio, para destruir toda carne.\\nE estará o arco nas nuvens, e eu o verei, para me lembrar do concerto eterno entre Deus e toda alma vivente de toda carne, que {está} sobre a terra.\\nE disse Deus a Noé: Este é o sinal do concerto que tenho estabelecido entre mim e toda a carne que {está} sobre a terra.\\nE os filhos de Noé, que da arca saíram, foram Sem, e Cam, e Jafé; e Cam {é} o pai de Canaã.\\nEstes três {foram} os filhos de Noé; e destes se povoou toda a terra.\\nE começou Noé a ser lavrador da terra e plantou uma vinha.\\nE bebeu do vinho e embebedou-se; e descobriu-se no meio de sua tenda.\\nE viu Cam, o pai de Canaã, a nudez de seu pai e fê-lo saber a ambos seus irmãos, fora.\\nEntão, tomaram Sem e Jafé uma capa, puseram-na sobre ambos os seus ombros e, indo virados para trás, cobriram a nudez do seu pai; e os seus rostos eram virados, de maneira que não viram a nudez do seu pai.\\nE despertou Noé do seu vinho e soube o que seu filho menor lhe fizera.\\nE disse: Maldito seja Canaã; servo dos servos seja aos seus irmãos.\\nE disse: Bendito seja o SENHOR, Deus de Sem; e seja-lhe Canaã por servo.\\nAlargue Deus a Jafé, e habite nas tendas de Sem; e seja-lhe Canaã por servo.\\nE viveu Noé, depois do dilúvio, trezentos e cinqüenta anos.\\nE foram todos os dias de Noé novecentos e cinqüenta anos, e morreu.\\nEstas, pois, são as gerações dos filhos de Noé: Sem, Cam e Jafé; e nasceram-lhes filhos depois do dilúvio.\\nOs filhos de Jafé {são:} Gomer, e Magogue, e Madai, e Javã, e Tubal, e Meseque, e Tiras.\\nE os filhos de Gomer {são:} Asquenaz, e Rifate, e Togarma.\\nE os filhos de Javã {são:} Elisá, e Társis, e Quitim, e Dodanim.\\nPor estes, foram repartidas as ilhas das nações nas suas terras, cada qual segundo a sua língua, segundo as suas famílias, entre as suas nações.\\nE os filhos de Cam {são:} Cuxe, e Mizraim, e Pute, e Canaã.\\nE os filhos de Cuxe {são:} Sebá, e Havilá, e Sabtá, e Raamá, e Sabtecá; e os filhos de Raamá são: Sabá e Dedã.\\nE Cuxe gerou a Ninrode; este começou a ser poderoso na terra.\\nE este foi poderoso caçador diante da face do SENHOR; pelo que se diz: Como Ninrode, poderoso caçador diante do SENHOR.\\nE o princípio do seu reino foi Babel, e Ereque, e Acade, e Calné, na terra de Sinar.\\nDesta mesma terra saiu ele à Assíria e edificou a Nínive, e Reobote-Ir, e Calá,\\ne Resém, entre Nínive e Calá (esta é a grande cidade).\\nE Mizraim gerou a Ludim, e a Anamim, e a Leabim, e a Naftuim,\\ne a Patrusim, e a Casluim (donde saíram os filisteus), e a Caftorim.\\nE Canaã gerou a Sidom, seu primogênito, e a Hete,\\ne ao jebuseu, e ao amorreu, e ao girgaseu,\\ne ao heveu, e ao arqueu, e ao sineu,\\ne ao arvadeu, e ao zemareu, e ao hamateu, e depois se espalharam as famílias dos cananeus.\\nE foi o termo dos cananeus desde Sidom, indo para Gerar, até Gaza; indo para Sodoma, e Gomorra, e Admá, e Zeboim, até Lasa.\\nEstes são os filhos de Cam, segundo as suas famílias, segundo as suas línguas, em suas terras, em suas nações.\\nE a Sem nasceram {filhos,} e ele {é} o pai de todos os filhos de Éber e o irmão mais velho de Jafé.\\nOs filhos de Sem {são:} Elão, e Assur, e Arfaxade, e Lude, e Arã.\\nE os filhos de Arã {são:} Uz, e Hul, e Geter, e Más.\\nE Arfaxade gerou a Salá; e Salá gerou a Éber.\\nE a Éber nasceram dois filhos: o nome de um {foi} Pelegue, {que significa divisão} porquanto em seus dias se repartiu a terra; e o nome do seu irmão foi Joctã.\\nE Joctã gerou a Almodá, e a Selefe, e a Hazar-Mavé, e a Jerá,\\ne a Hadorão, e a Uzal, e a Dicla,\\ne a Obal, e a Abimael, e a Sabá,\\ne a Ofir, e a Havilá, e a Jobabe; todos estes foram filhos de Joctã.\\nE foi a sua habitação desde Messa, indo para Sefar, montanha do Oriente.\\nEstes {são} os filhos de Sem, segundo as suas famílias, segundo as suas línguas, em suas terras, em suas nações.\\nEstas são as famílias dos filhos de Noé, segundo as suas gerações, em suas nações; e destes foram divididas as nações na terra, depois do dilúvio.\\nE era toda a terra de uma mesma língua e de uma mesma fala.\\nE aconteceu que, partindo eles do Oriente, acharam um vale na terra de Sinar; e habitaram ali.\\nE disseram uns aos outros: Eia, façamos tijolos e queimemo-los bem. E foi-lhes o tijolo por pedra, e o betume, por cal.\\nE disseram: Eia, edifiquemos nós uma cidade e uma torre cujo cume toque nos céus e façamo-nos um nome, para que não sejamos espalhados sobre a face de toda a terra.\\nEntão, desceu o SENHOR para ver a cidade e a torre que os filhos dos homens edificavam;\\ne o SENHOR disse: Eis que o povo é um, e todos têm uma mesma língua; e isto é o que começam a fazer; e, agora, não haverá restrição para tudo o que eles intentarem fazer.\\nEia, desçamos e confundamos ali a sua língua, para que não entenda um a língua do outro.\\nAssim, o SENHOR os espalhou dali sobre a face de toda a terra; e cessaram de edificar a cidade.\\nPor isso, se chamou o seu nome Babel, {que significa confusão} porquanto ali confundiu o SENHOR a língua de toda a terra e dali os espalhou o SENHOR sobre a face de toda a terra.\\nEstas são as gerações de Sem: Sem era da idade de cem anos e gerou a Arfaxade, dois anos depois do dilúvio.\\nE viveu Sem, depois que gerou a Arfaxade, quinhentos anos; e gerou filhos e filhas.\\nE viveu Arfaxade trinta e cinco anos e gerou a Salá.\\nE viveu Arfaxade, depois que gerou a Salá, quatrocentos e três anos; e gerou filhos e filhas.\\nE viveu Salá trinta anos e gerou a Éber.\\nE viveu Salá, depois que gerou a Éber, quatrocentos e três anos; e gerou filhos e filhas.\\nE viveu Éber trinta e quatro anos e gerou a Pelegue.\\nE viveu Éber, depois que gerou a Pelegue, quatrocentos e trinta anos; e gerou filhos e filhas.\\nE viveu Pelegue trinta anos e gerou a Reú.\\nE viveu Pelegue, depois que gerou a Reú, duzentos e nove anos; e gerou filhos e filhas.\\nE viveu Reú trinta e dois anos e gerou a Serugue.\\nE viveu Reú, depois que gerou a Serugue, duzentos e sete anos; e gerou filhos e filhas.\\nE viveu Serugue trinta anos e gerou a Naor.\\nE viveu Serugue, depois que gerou a Naor, duzentos anos; e gerou filhos e filhas.\\nE viveu Naor vinte e nove anos e gerou a Tera.\\nE viveu Naor, depois que gerou a Tera, cento e dezenove anos; e gerou filhos e filhas.\\nE viveu Tera setenta anos e gerou a Abrão, a Naor e a Harã.\\nE estas são as gerações de Tera: Tera gerou a Abrão, a Naor e a Harã; e Harã gerou a Ló.\\nE morreu Harã, estando seu pai Tera ainda vivo, na terra do seu nascimento, em Ur dos caldeus.\\nE tomaram Abrão e Naor mulheres para si; o nome da mulher de Abrão era Sarai, e o nome da mulher de Naor era Milca, filha de Harã, pai de Milca e pai de Iscá.\\nE Sarai foi estéril e não tinha filhos.\\nE tomou Tera a Abrão, seu filho, e a Ló, filho de Harã, filho de seu filho, e a Sarai, sua nora, mulher de seu filho Abrão, e saiu com eles de Ur dos caldeus, para ir à terra de Canaã; e vieram até Harã e habitaram ali.\\nE foram os dias de Tera duzentos e cinco anos; e morreu Tera em Harã.\\nOra, o SENHOR disse a Abrão: Sai-te da tua terra, e da tua parentela, e da casa de teu pai, para a terra que eu te mostrarei.\\nE far-te-ei uma grande nação, e abençoar-te-ei, e engrandecerei o teu nome, e {tu} serás uma bênção.\\nE abençoarei os que te abençoarem e amaldiçoarei os que te amaldiçoarem; e em ti serão benditas todas as famílias da terra.\\nAssim, partiu Abrão, como o SENHOR lhe tinha dito, e foi Ló com ele; e era Abrão da idade de setenta e cinco anos, quando saiu de Harã.\\nE tomou Abrão a Sarai, sua mulher, e a Ló, filho de seu irmão, e toda a sua fazenda, que haviam adquirido, e as almas que lhe acresceram em Harã; e saíram para irem à terra de Canaã; e vieram à terra de Canaã.\\nE passou Abrão por aquela terra até ao lugar de Siquém, até ao carvalho de Moré; e {estavam,} então, os cananeus na terra.\\nE apareceu o SENHOR a Abrão e disse: À tua semente darei esta terra. E edificou ali um altar ao SENHOR, que lhe aparecera.\\nE moveu-se dali para a montanha à banda do oriente de Betel e armou a sua tenda, {tendo} Betel ao ocidente e Ai ao oriente; e edificou ali um altar ao SENHOR e invocou o nome do SENHOR.\\nDepois, caminhou Abrão {dali,} seguindo ainda para a banda do Sul.\\nE havia fome naquela terra; e desceu Abrão ao Egito, para peregrinar ali, porquanto a fome era grande na terra.\\nE aconteceu que, chegando ele para entrar no Egito, disse a Sarai, sua mulher: Ora, bem sei que és mulher formosa à vista;\\ne será que, quando os egípcios te virem, dirão: Esta é a sua mulher. E matar-me-ão a mim e a ti te guardarão em vida.\\nDize, peço-te, {que} és minha irmã, para que me vá bem por tua causa, e que viva a minha alma por amor de ti.\\nE aconteceu que, entrando Abrão no Egito, viram os egípcios a mulher, que era mui formosa.\\nE viram-na os príncipes de Faraó e gabaram-na diante de Faraó; e foi a mulher tomada para a casa de Faraó.\\nE fez bem a Abrão por amor dela; e ele teve ovelhas, e vacas, e jumentos, e servos, e servas, e jumentas, e camelos.\\nFeriu, porém, o SENHOR a Faraó com grandes pragas e a sua casa, por causa de Sarai, mulher de Abrão.\\nEntão, chamou Faraó a Abrão e disse: Que é isto {que} me fizeste? Por que não me disseste que ela {era} tua mulher?\\nPor que disseste: É minha irmã? De maneira que a houvera tomado por minha mulher; agora, pois, eis aqui tua mulher; toma-{a} e vai-te.\\nE Faraó deu ordens aos seus varões a seu respeito, e acompanharam-no a ele, e a sua mulher, e a tudo o que tinha.\\nSubiu, pois, Abrão do Egito para a banda do Sul, ele, e sua mulher, e tudo o que tinha, e com ele Ló.\\nE {ia} Abrão muito rico em gado, em prata e em ouro.\\nE fez as suas jornadas do Sul até Betel, até ao lugar onde, ao princípio, estivera a sua tenda, entre Betel e Ai;\\naté ao lugar do altar que, dantes, ali tinha feito; e Abrão invocou ali o nome do SENHOR.\\nE também Ló, que ia com Abrão, tinha rebanhos, e vacas, e tendas.\\nE não tinha capacidade a terra para {poderem} habitar juntos, porque a sua fazenda era muita; de maneira que não podiam habitar juntos.\\nE houve contenda entre os pastores do gado de Abrão e os pastores do gado de Ló; e os cananeus e os ferezeus habitavam, então, na terra.\\nE disse Abrão a Ló: Ora, não haja contenda entre mim e ti e entre os meus pastores e os teus pastores, porque irmãos somos.\\nNão está toda a terra diante de ti? Eia, pois, aparta-te de mim; se {escolheres} a esquerda, irei para a direita; e, se a direita {escolheres,} eu irei para a esquerda.\\nE levantou Ló os seus olhos e viu toda a campina do Jordão, que {era} toda bem regada, antes de o SENHOR ter destruído Sodoma e Gomorra, e {era} como o jardim do SENHOR, como a terra do Egito, quando se entra em Zoar.\\nEntão, Ló escolheu para si toda a campina do Jordão e partiu Ló para o Oriente; e apartaram-se um do outro.\\nHabitou Abrão na terra de Canaã, e Ló habitou nas cidades da campina e armou as suas tendas até Sodoma.\\nOra, {eram} maus os varões de Sodoma e grandes pecadores contra o SENHOR.\\nE disse o SENHOR a Abrão, depois que Ló se apartou dele: Levanta, agora, os teus olhos e olha desde o lugar onde estás, para a banda do norte, e do sul, e do oriente, e do ocidente;\\nporque toda esta terra que vês te hei de dar a ti e à tua semente, para sempre.\\nE farei a tua semente como o pó da terra; de maneira que, se alguém puder contar o pó da terra, também a tua semente será contada.\\nLevanta-te, percorre essa terra, no seu comprimento e na sua largura; porque a ti a darei.\\nE Abrão armou as suas tendas, e veio, e habitou nos carvalhais de Manre, que estão junto a Hebrom; e edificou ali um altar ao SENHOR.\\nE aconteceu, nos dias de Anrafel, rei de Sinar, Arioque, rei de Elasar, Quedorlaomer, rei de Elão, e Tidal, rei de Goim, {que significa nações}\\nque {estes} fizeram guerra a Bera, rei de Sodoma, a Birsa, rei de Gomorra, a Sinabe, rei de Admá, e a Semeber, rei de Zeboim, e ao rei de Bela (esta é Zoar).\\nTodos estes se ajuntaram no vale de Sidim (que é o mar de Sal).\\nDoze anos haviam servido a Quedorlaomer, mas, ao décimo terceiro ano, rebelaram-se.\\nE, ao décimo quarto ano, veio Quedorlaomer e os reis que estavam com ele e feriram aos refains em Asterote-Carnaim, e aos zuzins em Hã, e aos emins em Savé-Quiriataim,\\ne aos horeus no seu monte Seir, até à campina de Parã, que {está} junto ao deserto.\\nDepois, tornaram, e vieram a En-Mispate (que é Cades), e feriram toda a terra dos amalequitas e também os amorreus, que habitavam em Hazazom-Tamar.\\nEntão, saiu o rei de Sodoma, e o rei de Gomorra, e o rei de Admá, e o rei de Zeboim, e o rei de Bela (esta é Zoar) e ordenaram batalha contra eles no vale de Sidim,\\ncontra Quedorlaomer, rei de Elão, e Tidal, rei de Goim, e Anrafel, rei de Sinar, e Arioque, rei de Elasar; quatro reis contra cinco.\\nE o vale de Sidim estava cheio de poços de betume; e fugiram os reis de Sodoma e de Gomorra e caíram ali; e os restantes fugiram para um monte.\\nE tomaram toda a fazenda de Sodoma e de Gomorra e todo o seu mantimento e foram-se.\\nTambém tomaram a Ló, que habitava em Sodoma, filho do irmão de Abrão, e a sua fazenda e foram-se.\\nEntão, veio um que escapara e o contou a Abrão, o hebreu; ele habitava junto dos carvalhais de Manre, o amorreu, irmão de Escol e irmão de Aner; eles eram confederados de Abrão.\\nOuvindo, pois, Abrão que o seu irmão estava preso, armou os seus criados, nascidos em sua casa, trezentos e dezoito, e os perseguiu até Dã.\\nE dividiu-se contra eles de noite, ele e os seus criados, e os feriu, e os perseguiu até Hobá, que {fica} à esquerda de Damasco.\\nE tornou a trazer toda a fazenda e tornou a trazer também a Ló, seu irmão, e a sua fazenda, e também as mulheres, e o povo.\\nE o rei de Sodoma saiu-lhes ao encontro (depois que voltou de ferir a Quedorlaomer e aos reis que {estavam} com ele) no vale de Savé, que {é} o vale do Rei.\\nE Melquisedeque, rei de Salém, trouxe pão e vinho; e este {era} sacerdote do Deus Altíssimo.\\nE abençoou-o e disse: Bendito {seja} Abrão do Deus Altíssimo, o Possuidor dos céus e da terra;\\ne bendito {seja} o Deus Altíssimo, que entregou os teus inimigos nas tuas mãos. E deu-lhe o dízimo de tudo.\\nE o rei de Sodoma disse a Abrão: Dá-me a mim as almas e a fazenda toma para ti.\\nAbrão, porém, disse ao rei de Sodoma: Levantei minha mão ao SENHOR, o Deus Altíssimo, o Possuidor dos céus e da terra,\\ne juro que, desde um fio até à correia dum sapato, não {tomarei} coisa alguma de tudo o que {é} teu; para que não digas: Eu enriqueci a Abrão;\\nsalvo tão-somente o que os jovens comeram e a parte {que toca} aos varões que comigo foram, Aner, Escol e Manre; estes que tomem a sua parte.\\nDepois destas coisas veio a palavra do SENHOR a Abrão em visão, dizendo: Não temas, Abrão, eu sou o teu escudo, o teu grandíssimo galardão.\\nEntão, disse Abrão: Senhor JEOVÁ, que me hás de dar? Pois ando sem filhos, e o mordomo da minha casa é o damasceno Eliézer.\\nDisse mais Abrão: Eis que me não tens dado semente, e eis que um nascido na minha casa será o meu herdeiro.\\nE eis que {veio} a palavra do SENHOR a ele, dizendo: Este não será o teu herdeiro; mas aquele que de ti será gerado, esse será o teu herdeiro.\\nEntão, o levou fora e disse: Olha, agora, para os céus e conta as estrelas, se as podes contar. E disse-lhe: Assim será a tua semente.\\nE creu ele no SENHOR, e foi-lhe {ou contou-lhe} imputado isto {por} justiça.\\nDisse-lhe mais: Eu {sou} o SENHOR, que te tirei de Ur dos caldeus, para dar-te a ti esta terra, para a herdares.\\nE disse ele: Senhor JEOVÁ, como saberei que hei de herdá-la?\\nE disse-lhe: Toma-me uma bezerra de três anos, e uma cabra de três anos, e um carneiro de três anos, e uma rola, e um pombinho.\\nE trouxe-lhe todos estes, e partiu-os pelo meio, e pôs cada parte deles em frente da outra; mas as aves não partiu.\\nE as aves desciam sobre os cadáveres; Abrão, porém, as enxotava.\\nE, pondo-se o sol, um profundo sono caiu sobre Abrão; e eis que grande espanto e grande escuridão caíram sobre ele.\\nEntão, disse a Abrão: Saibas, decerto, que peregrina será a tua semente em terra {que} não {é} sua; e servi-los-á e afligi-la-ão quatrocentos anos.\\nMas também eu julgarei a gente à qual servirão, e depois sairão com grande fazenda.\\nE tu irás a teus pais em paz; em boa velhice serás sepultado.\\nE a quarta geração tornará para cá; porque a medida da injustiça dos amorreus não {está} ainda cheia.\\nE sucedeu que, posto o sol, houve escuridão; e eis um forno de fumaça e uma tocha de fogo que passou por aquelas metades.\\nNaquele mesmo dia, fez o SENHOR um concerto com Abrão, dizendo: À tua semente tenho dado esta terra, desde o rio do Egito até ao grande rio Eufrates,\\ne o queneu, e o quenezeu, e o cadmoneu,\\ne o heteu, e o ferezeu, e os refains,\\ne o amorreu, e o cananeu, e o girgaseu, e o jebuseu.\\nOra, Sarai, mulher de Abrão, não lhe gerava filhos, e ele tinha uma serva egípcia, cujo nome {era} Agar.\\nE disse Sarai a Abrão: Eis que o SENHOR me tem impedido de gerar; entra, pois, à minha serva; porventura, terei {ou serei dela edificada} filhos dela. E ouviu Abrão a voz de Sarai.\\nAssim, tomou Sarai, mulher de Abrão, a Agar, egípcia, sua serva, e deu-a por mulher a Abrão, seu marido, ao fim de dez anos que Abrão habitara na terra de Canaã.\\nE ele entrou a Agar, e ela concebeu; e, vendo ela que concebera, foi sua senhora desprezada aos seus olhos.\\nEntão, disse Sarai a Abrão: Meu agravo {seja} sobre ti. Minha serva pus eu em teu regaço; vendo ela, agora, que concebeu, sou menosprezada aos seus olhos. O SENHOR julgue entre mim e ti.\\nE disse Abrão a Sarai: Eis que tua serva {está} na tua mão; faze-lhe o que bom {é} aos teus olhos. E afligiu-a Sarai, e ela fugiu de sua face.\\nE o Anjo do SENHOR a achou junto a uma fonte de água no deserto, junto à fonte no caminho de Sur.\\nE disse: Agar, serva de Sarai, de onde vens e para onde vais? E {ela} disse: Venho fugida da face de Sarai, minha senhora.\\nEntão, lhe disse o Anjo do SENHOR: Torna-te para tua senhora e humilha-te debaixo de suas mãos.\\nDisse-lhe mais o Anjo do SENHOR: Multiplicarei sobremaneira a tua semente, que não será contada, por numerosa {que} será.\\nDisse-lhe também o Anjo do SENHOR: Eis que concebeste, e terás um filho, e chamarás o seu nome Ismael, {que significa Deus (está) ouvindo} porquanto o SENHOR ouviu a tua aflição.\\nE ele será homem {Heb. como um jumento bravo} bravo; e a sua mão {será} contra todos, e a mão de todos, contra ele; e habitará diante da face de todos os seus irmãos.\\nE {ela} chamou o nome do SENHOR, que com ela falava: Tu {ou Tu és um Deus que me vês} és Deus da vista, porque disse: Não olhei eu também para aquele que me vê?\\nPor isso, se chama aquele poço de Laai-Roi; {que significa aquele que vive e me vê} eis que {está} entre Cades e Berede.\\nE Agar deu um filho a Abrão; e Abrão chamou o nome do seu filho que tivera Agar, Ismael.\\nE {era} Abrão da idade de oitenta e seis anos, quando Agar deu Ismael a Abrão.\\nSendo, pois, Abrão da idade de noventa e nove anos, apareceu o SENHOR a Abrão e disse-lhe: Eu {sou} o Deus Todo-poderoso; anda em minha presença e sê perfeito.\\nE porei o meu concerto entre mim e ti e te multiplicarei grandissimamente.\\nEntão, caiu Abrão sobre o seu rosto, e falou Deus com ele, dizendo:\\nQuanto a mim, eis o meu concerto contigo é, e serás o pai de uma multidão de nações.\\nE não se chamará mais o teu nome Abrão, {que significa pai da altura} mas Abraão {que significa pai de uma multidão} será o teu nome; porque por pai da multidão de nações te tenho posto.\\nE te farei frutificar grandissimamente e de ti farei nações, e reis sairão de ti.\\nE estabelecerei o meu concerto entre mim e ti e a tua semente depois de ti em suas gerações, por concerto perpétuo, para te ser a ti por Deus e à tua semente depois de ti.\\nE te darei a ti e à tua semente depois de ti a terra de tuas peregrinações, toda a terra de Canaã em perpétua possessão, e ser-lhes-ei o seu Deus.\\nDisse mais Deus a Abraão: Tu, porém, guardarás o meu concerto, tu e a tua semente depois de ti, nas suas gerações.\\nEste {é} o meu concerto, que guardareis entre mim e vós e a tua semente depois de ti: {Que} todo macho será circuncidado.\\nE circuncidareis a carne do vosso prepúcio; e {isto} será por sinal do concerto entre mim e vós.\\nO filho de oito dias, pois, será circuncidado; todo macho nas vossas gerações, o nascido na casa e o comprado por dinheiro a qualquer estrangeiro, que não {for} da tua semente.\\nCom efeito, será circuncidado o nascido em tua casa e o comprado por teu dinheiro; e estará o meu concerto na vossa carne por concerto perpétuo.\\nE o macho com prepúcio, cuja carne do prepúcio não estiver circuncidada, aquela alma será extirpada dos seus povos; quebrantou o meu concerto.\\nDisse Deus mais a Abraão: a Sarai, tua mulher, não chamarás {mais} pelo nome de Sarai, mas Sara {que significa princesa} {será} o seu nome.\\nPorque eu a hei de abençoar e te hei de dar a ti dela um filho; e a abençoarei, e será {mãe} das nações; reis de povos sairão dela.\\nEntão, caiu Abraão sobre o seu rosto, e riu-se, e disse no seu coração: A um homem de cem anos há de nascer {um filho?} E conceberá Sara na idade de noventa anos?\\nE disse Abraão a Deus: Tomara que viva Ismael diante de teu rosto!\\nE disse Deus: Na verdade, Sara, tua mulher, te dará um filho, e chamarás o seu nome Isaque; {que significa riso} e com ele estabelecerei o meu concerto, por concerto perpétuo para a sua semente depois dele.\\nE, quanto a Ismael, {também} te tenho ouvido: eis aqui o tenho abençoado, e fá-lo-ei frutificar, e fá-lo-ei multiplicar grandissimamente; doze príncipes gerará, e dele farei uma grande nação.\\nO meu concerto, porém, estabelecerei com Isaque, o qual Sara te dará neste tempo determinado, no ano seguinte.\\nE acabou de falar com ele e subiu Deus de Abraão.\\nEntão, tomou Abraão a seu filho Ismael, e a todos os nascidos na sua casa, e a todos os comprados por seu dinheiro, todo macho entre os homens da casa de Abraão; e circuncidou a carne do seu prepúcio, naquele mesmo dia, como Deus falara com ele.\\nE {era} Abraão da idade de noventa e nove anos, quando lhe foi circuncidada a carne do seu prepúcio.\\nE Ismael, seu filho, {era} da idade de treze anos, quando lhe foi circuncidada a carne do seu prepúcio.\\nNeste mesmo dia, foi circuncidado Abraão e Ismael, seu filho.\\nE todos os homens da sua casa, o nascido em casa e o comprado por dinheiro do estrangeiro, foram circuncidados com ele.\\nDepois, apareceu-lhe o SENHOR nos carvalhais de Manre, estando ele assentado à porta da tenda, quando {ou no maior calor do dia} tinha aquecido o dia.\\nE levantou os olhos e olhou, e eis três varões estavam em pé junto a ele. E, vendo-{os,} correu da porta da tenda ao seu encontro, e inclinou-se à terra,\\ne disse: Meu Senhor, se agora tenho achado graça aos teus olhos, rogo-te que não passes de teu servo.\\nTraga-se, agora, um pouco de água; e lavai os vossos pés e recostai-vos debaixo desta árvore;\\ne trarei um bocado de pão, para que esforceis o vosso coração; depois, passareis adiante, porquanto por isso chegastes até vosso servo. E disseram: Assim, faze como tens dito.\\nE Abraão apressou-se em ir ter com Sara à tenda e disse-lhe: Amassa depressa três medidas de flor de farinha e faze bolos.\\nE correu Abraão às vacas, e tomou uma vitela tenra e boa, e deu-{a} ao moço, que se apressou em prepará-la.\\nE tomou manteiga e leite e a vitela que tinha preparado e pôs {tudo} diante deles; e ele estava em pé junto a eles debaixo da árvore; e comeram.\\nE disseram-lhe: Onde {está} Sara, tua mulher? E ele disse: Ei-la, {aí está} na tenda.\\nE disse: Certamente tornarei a ti por {este} tempo da vida; e eis que Sara, tua mulher, terá um filho. E ouviu-{o} Sara à porta da tenda, que {estava} atrás dele.\\nE {eram} Abraão e Sara já velhos {e} adiantados em idade; já a Sara havia cessado o costume das mulheres.\\nAssim, pois, riu-se Sara consigo, dizendo: Terei {ainda} deleite depois de haver envelhecido, sendo também o meu senhor já velho?\\nE disse o SENHOR a Abraão: Por que se riu Sara, dizendo: Na verdade, gerarei eu ainda, havendo já envelhecido?\\nHaveria coisa alguma difícil ao SENHOR? Ao tempo determinado, tornarei a ti por {este} tempo da vida, e Sara terá um filho.\\nE Sara negou, dizendo: Não me ri, porquanto temeu. E {ele} disse: Não {digas isso,} porque te riste.\\nE levantaram-se aqueles varões dali e olharam para a banda de Sodoma; e Abraão ia com eles, acompanhando-os.\\nE disse o SENHOR: Ocultarei eu a Abraão o que faço,\\nvisto que Abraão certamente virá a ser uma grande e poderosa nação, e nele serão benditas todas as nações da terra?\\nPorque eu o tenho conhecido, que ele há de ordenar a seus filhos e a sua casa depois dele, para que guardem o caminho do SENHOR, para agirem {com} justiça e juízo; para que o SENHOR faça vir sobre Abraão o que acerca dele tem falado.\\nDisse mais o SENHOR: Porquanto o clamor de Sodoma e Gomorra se tem multiplicado, e porquanto o seu pecado se tem agravado muito,\\ndescerei agora e verei se, com efeito, têm praticado segundo este clamor que é vindo até mim; e, se não, sabê-lo-ei.\\nEntão, viraram aqueles varões o rosto dali e foram-se para Sodoma; mas Abraão ficou ainda em pé diante da face do SENHOR.\\nE chegou-se Abraão, dizendo: Destruirás também o justo com o ímpio?\\nSe, porventura, houver cinqüenta justos na cidade, destruí-los-ás também e não pouparás o lugar por causa dos cinqüenta justos que {estão} dentro dela?\\nLonge de ti que faças tal coisa, que mates o justo com o ímpio; que o justo seja como o ímpio, longe de ti {seja.} Não faria justiça o Juiz de toda a terra?\\nEntão, disse o SENHOR: Se eu em Sodoma achar cinqüenta justos dentro da cidade, pouparei todo o lugar por amor deles.\\nE respondeu Abraão, dizendo: Eis que, agora, me atrevi a falar ao Senhor, ainda que {sou} pó e cinza.\\nSe, porventura, faltarem de cinqüenta justos cinco, destruirás por aqueles cinco toda a cidade? E disse: Não {a} destruirei, se eu achar ali quarenta e cinco.\\nE continuou ainda a falar-lhe e disse: Se, porventura, acharem ali quarenta? E disse: Não {o} farei, por amor dos quarenta.\\nDisse mais: Ora, não se ire o Senhor, se eu {ainda} falar: se, porventura, se acharem ali trinta? E disse: Não {o} farei se achar ali trinta.\\nE disse: Eis que, agora, me atrevi a falar ao Senhor: se, porventura, se acharem ali vinte? E disse: Não {a} destruirei, por amor dos vinte.\\nDisse mais: Ora, não se ire o Senhor que {ainda} só mais esta vez falo: se, porventura, se acharem ali dez? E disse: Não {a} destruirei, por amor dos dez.\\nE foi-se o SENHOR, quando acabou de falar a Abraão; e Abraão tornou ao seu lugar.\\nE vieram os dois anjos a Sodoma à tarde, e estava Ló assentado à porta de Sodoma; e, vendo-{os} Ló, levantou-se ao seu encontro e inclinou-se com o rosto à terra.\\nE disse: Eis agora, meus senhores, entrai, peço-vos, em casa de vosso servo, e passai {nela} a noite, e lavai os vossos pés; e de madrugada vos levantareis e ireis vosso caminho. E eles disseram: Não! Antes, na rua passaremos a noite.\\nE porfiou com eles muito, e vieram com ele e entraram em sua casa; e fez-lhes banquete e cozeu bolos sem levedura, e comeram.\\nE, antes que se deitassem, cercaram a casa os varões daquela cidade, os varões de Sodoma, desde o moço até ao velho; todo o povo de todos os bairros.\\nE chamaram Ló e disseram-lhe: Onde {estão} os varões que a ti vieram nesta noite? Traze-os fora a nós, para que os conheçamos.\\nEntão, saiu Ló a eles à porta, e fechou a porta atrás de si,\\ne disse: Meus irmãos, rogo-vos que não façais mal.\\nEis aqui, duas filhas tenho, que {ainda} não conheceram varão; fora vo-las trarei, e fareis delas como bom {for} nos vossos olhos; somente nada façais a estes varões, porque por isso vieram à sombra do meu telhado.\\nEles, porém, disseram: Sai daí. Disseram mais: Como estrangeiro, este indivíduo veio {aqui} habitar e quereria ser juiz em tudo? Agora, te faremos mais mal a ti do que a eles. E arremessaram-se sobre o varão, {sobre} Ló, e aproximaram-se para arrombar a porta.\\nAqueles varões, porém, estenderam a sua mão, e fizeram entrar a Ló consigo na casa, e fecharam a porta;\\ne feriram de cegueira os varões que {estavam} à porta da casa, desde o menor até ao maior, de maneira que se cansaram para achar a porta.\\nEntão, disseram aqueles varões a Ló: Tens alguém mais aqui? Teu genro, e teus filhos, e tuas filhas, e todos quantos tens nesta cidade, tira-os fora deste lugar;\\npois nós vamos destruir este lugar, porque o seu clamor tem engrossado diante da face do SENHOR, e o SENHOR nos enviou a destruí-lo.\\nEntão, saiu Ló, e falou a seus genros, aos que haviam de tomar as suas filhas, e disse: Levantai-vos; saí deste lugar, porque o SENHOR há de destruir a cidade. Foi tido, porém, por zombador aos olhos de seus genros.\\nE, ao amanhecer, os anjos apertaram com Ló, dizendo: Levanta-te, toma tua mulher e tuas duas filhas que aqui estão, para que não pereças na injustiça desta cidade.\\nEle, porém, demorava-se, e aqueles varões lhe pegaram pela mão, e pela mão de sua mulher, e pela mão de suas duas filhas, sendo-lhe o Senhor misericordioso, e tiraram-no, e puseram-no fora da cidade.\\nE aconteceu que, tirando-os fora, disse: Escapa-te por tua vida; não olhes para trás de ti e não pares em toda esta campina; escapa lá para o monte, para que não pereças.\\nE Ló disse-lhe: Assim, não, Senhor!\\nEis que, agora, o teu servo tem achado graça aos teus olhos, e engrandeceste a tua misericórdia que a mim me fizeste, para guardar a minha alma em vida; mas não posso escapar no monte, pois que tenho medo que me apanhe este mal, e eu morra.\\nEis, agora, aquela cidade {está} perto, para fugir para lá, e {é} pequena; ora, {para} ali me escaparei (não {é} pequena?), para que minha alma viva.\\nE disse-lhe: Eis aqui, tenho-te aceitado também neste negócio, para não derribar esta cidade de que falaste.\\nApressa-te, escapa-te para ali; porque nada poderei fazer, enquanto não tiveres ali chegado. Por isso, se chamou o nome da cidade Zoar. {que significa pequena}\\nSaiu o sol sobre a terra, quando Ló entrou em Zoar.\\nEntão, o SENHOR fez chover enxofre e fogo, do SENHOR desde os céus, sobre Sodoma e Gomorra.\\nE derribou aquelas cidades, e toda aquela campina, e todos os moradores daquelas cidades, e o que nascia da terra.\\nE a mulher de Ló olhou para trás e ficou convertida numa estátua de sal.\\nE Abraão levantou-se aquela mesma manhã de madrugada e foi para aquele lugar onde estivera diante da face do SENHOR.\\nE olhou para Sodoma e Gomorra e para toda a terra da campina; e viu, e eis que a fumaça da terra subia, como a fumaça duma fornalha.\\nE aconteceu que, destruindo Deus as cidades da campina, Deus se lembrou de Abraão e tirou Ló do meio da destruição, derribando aquelas cidades em que Ló habitara.\\nE subiu Ló de Zoar e habitou no monte, e as suas duas filhas com ele, porque temia habitar em Zoar; e habitou numa caverna, ele e as suas duas filhas.\\nEntão, a primogênita disse à menor: Nosso pai {é} já velho, e não {há} varão na terra que entre a nós, segundo o costume de toda a terra.\\nVem, demos a beber vinho a nosso pai e deitemo-nos com ele, para que em vida conservemos semente de nosso pai.\\nE deram a beber vinho a seu pai naquela noite; e veio a primogênita e deitou-se com seu pai, e não sentiu ele quando ela se deitou, nem quando se levantou.\\nE sucedeu, no outro dia, que a primogênita disse à menor: Vês aqui, eu já ontem à noite me deitei com meu pai; demos-lhe a beber vinho também esta noite, e então entra tu, deita-te com ele, para que em vida conservemos semente de nosso pai.\\nE deram a beber vinho a seu pai, também naquela noite; e levantou-se a menor e deitou-se com ele; e não sentiu ele quando ela se deitou, nem quando se levantou.\\nE conceberam as duas filhas de Ló de seu pai.\\nE teve a primogênita um filho e chamou o seu nome Moabe; este {é} o pai dos moabitas, até ao dia de hoje.\\nE a menor também teve um filho e chamou o seu nome Ben-Ami; este {é} o pai dos filhos de Amom, até o dia de hoje.\\nE partiu Abraão dali para a terra do Sul e habitou entre Cades e Sur; e peregrinou em Gerar.\\nE, havendo Abraão dito de Sara, sua mulher: {É} minha irmã, enviou Abimeleque, rei de Gerar, e tomou a Sara.\\nDeus, porém, veio a Abimeleque em sonhos de noite e disse-lhe: Eis que morto {és} por causa da mulher que tomaste; porque ela {está} casada com marido.\\nMas Abimeleque {ainda} não se tinha chegado a ela; por isso, disse: Senhor, matarás também uma nação justa?\\nNão me disse ele mesmo: É minha irmã? E ela também disse: É meu irmão. Em sinceridade do coração e em pureza das minhas mãos, tenho feito isto.\\nE disse-lhe Deus em sonhos: Bem sei eu que na sinceridade do teu coração fizeste isto; e também eu te tenho impedido de pecar contra mim; por isso, te não permiti tocá-la.\\nAgora, pois, restitui a mulher ao seu marido, porque profeta é e rogará por ti, para que vivas; porém, se não lha restituíres, sabe que certamente morrerás, tu e tudo o que é teu.\\nE levantou-se Abimeleque pela manhã, de madrugada, chamou todos os seus servos e falou todas estas palavras em seus ouvidos; e temeram muito aqueles varões.\\nEntão, chamou Abimeleque a Abraão e disse-lhe: Que nos fizeste? E em que pequei contra ti, para trazeres sobre mim e meu reino tamanho pecado? Tu me fizeste aquilo que não deverias ter feito.\\nDisse mais Abimeleque a Abraão: Que tens visto, para fazeres tal coisa?\\nE disse Abraão: Porque eu dizia comigo: Certamente não {há} temor de Deus neste lugar, e eles me matarão por amor da minha mulher.\\nE, na verdade, é ela também minha irmã, filha de meu pai, mas não filha da minha mãe; e veio a ser minha mulher.\\nE aconteceu que, fazendo-me Deus sair errante da casa de meu pai, eu lhe disse: {Seja} esta a graça que me farás em todo o lugar aonde viermos: dize de mim: {É} meu irmão.\\nEntão, tomou Abimeleque ovelhas, e vacas, e servos, e servas e os deu a Abraão; e restituiu-lhe Sara, sua mulher.\\nE disse Abimeleque: Eis que a minha terra {está} diante da tua face; habita onde bom {for} aos teus olhos.\\nE a Sara disse: Vês que tenho dado ao teu irmão mil {moedas} de prata; eis que elas te sejam por véu dos olhos para com todos os que contigo {estão} e até para com todos os {outros;} e estás advertida.\\nE orou Abraão a Deus, e sarou Deus a Abimeleque, e a sua mulher, e as suas servas, de maneira que tiveram filhos;\\nporque o SENHOR havia fechado totalmente todas as madres da casa de Abimeleque, por causa de Sara, mulher de Abraão.\\nE o SENHOR visitou a Sara, como tinha dito; e fez o SENHOR a Sara como tinha falado.\\nE concebeu Sara e deu a Abraão um filho na sua velhice, ao tempo determinado, que Deus lhe tinha dito.\\nE chamou Abraão o nome de seu filho que lhe nascera, que Sara lhe dera, Isaque.\\nE Abraão circuncidou o seu filho Isaque, quando era da idade de oito dias, como Deus lhe tinha ordenado.\\nE {era} Abraão da idade de cem anos, quando lhe nasceu Isaque, seu filho.\\nE disse Sara: Deus me tem feito riso; e todo aquele que o ouvir se rirá comigo.\\nDisse mais: Quem diria a Abraão que Sara daria de mamar a filhos, porque lhe dei um filho na sua velhice?\\nE cresceu o menino e foi desmamado; então, Abraão fez um grande banquete no dia em que Isaque foi desmamado.\\nE viu Sara que o filho de Agar, a egípcia, que esta tinha dado a Abraão, zombava.\\nE disse a Abraão: Deita fora esta serva e o seu filho; porque o filho desta serva não herdará com meu filho, com Isaque.\\nE pareceu esta palavra mui má aos olhos de Abraão, por causa de seu filho.\\nPorém Deus disse a Abraão: Não te pareça mal aos teus olhos acerca do moço e acerca da tua serva; em tudo o que Sara te diz, ouve a sua voz; porque em Isaque será chamada a tua semente.\\nMas também do filho desta serva farei uma nação, porquanto {é} tua semente.\\nEntão, se levantou Abraão pela manhã, de madrugada, e tomou pão e um odre de água, e os deu a Agar, pondo-os sobre o seu ombro; também {lhe deu} o menino e despediu-a; e ela foi-se, andando errante no deserto de Berseba.\\nE, consumida a água do odre, lançou o menino debaixo de uma das árvores.\\nE foi-se e assentou-se em frente, afastando-se a distância de um tiro de arco; porque dizia: Que não veja eu morrer o menino. E assentou-se em frente, e levantou a sua voz, e chorou.\\nE ouviu Deus a voz do menino, e bradou o Anjo de Deus a Agar desde os céus e disse-lhe: Que tens, Agar? Não temas, porque Deus ouviu a voz do rapaz desde o lugar onde {está.}\\nErgue-te, levanta o moço e pega-lhe pela mão, porque dele farei uma grande nação.\\nE abriu-lhe Deus os olhos; e viu um poço de água, e foi-se, e encheu o odre de água, e deu de beber ao moço.\\nE era Deus com o moço, que cresceu, e habitou no deserto, e foi flecheiro.\\nE habitou no deserto de Parã; e sua mãe tomou-lhe mulher da terra do Egito.\\nE aconteceu, naquele mesmo tempo, que Abimeleque, com Ficol, príncipe {ou capitão-mor} do seu exército, falou com Abraão, dizendo: Deus {é} contigo em tudo o que fazes;\\nagora, pois, jura-me aqui por Deus que me não mentirás a mim, nem a meu filho, nem a meu neto; segundo a beneficência que te fiz, me farás a mim e à terra onde peregrinaste.\\nE disse Abraão: Eu jurarei.\\nAbraão, porém, repreendeu a Abimeleque por causa de um poço de água que os servos de Abimeleque haviam tomado por força.\\nEntão, disse Abimeleque: Eu não sei quem fez isto; e também tu mo não fizeste saber, nem eu o ouvi senão hoje.\\nE tomou Abraão ovelhas e vacas e deu-as a Abimeleque; e fizeram ambos concerto.\\nPôs Abraão, porém, à parte sete cordeiras do rebanho.\\nE Abimeleque disse a Abraão: Para que estão aqui estas sete cordeiras, que puseste à parte?\\nE disse: Tomarás {estas} sete cordeiras de minha mão, para que sejam em testemunho que eu cavei este poço.\\nPor isso, se chamou aquele lugar Berseba, {Heb. Beer-Seba, que significa poço do juramento} porquanto ambos juraram ali.\\nAssim, fizeram concerto em Berseba. Depois, se levantou Abimeleque e Ficol, príncipe do seu exército, e tornaram para a terra dos filisteus.\\nE plantou um bosque em Berseba e invocou lá o nome do SENHOR, Deus eterno.\\nE peregrinou Abraão na terra dos filisteus muitos dias.\\nE aconteceu, depois destas coisas, que tentou Deus a Abraão e disse-lhe: Abraão! E ele disse: Eis-me {aqui.}\\nE disse: Toma agora o teu filho, o teu único filho, Isaque, a quem amas, e vai-te à terra de Moriá; e oferece-o ali em holocausto sobre uma das montanhas, que eu te direi.\\nEntão, se levantou Abraão pela manhã, de madrugada, e albardou o seu jumento, e tomou consigo dois de seus moços e Isaque, seu filho; e fendeu lenha para o holocausto, e levantou-se, e foi ao lugar que Deus lhe dissera.\\nAo terceiro dia, levantou Abraão os seus olhos e viu o lugar de longe.\\nE disse Abraão a seus moços: Ficai-vos aqui com o jumento, e eu e o moço iremos até ali; e, havendo adorado, tornaremos a vós.\\nE tomou Abraão a lenha do holocausto e pô-la sobre Isaque, seu filho; e ele tomou o fogo e o cutelo na sua mão. E foram ambos juntos.\\nEntão, falou Isaque a Abraão, seu pai, e disse: Meu pai! E ele disse: Eis-me {aqui,} meu filho! E ele disse: Eis aqui o fogo e a lenha, mas onde {está} o cordeiro para o holocausto?\\nE disse Abraão: Deus proverá para si o cordeiro para o holocausto, meu filho. Assim, caminharam ambos juntos.\\nE vieram ao lugar que Deus lhes dissera, e edificou Abraão ali um altar, e pôs em ordem a lenha, e amarrou a Isaque, seu filho, e deitou-o sobre o altar em cima da lenha.\\nE estendeu Abraão a sua mão e tomou o cutelo para imolar o seu filho.\\nMas o Anjo do SENHOR lhe bradou desde os céus e disse: Abraão, Abraão! E ele disse: Eis-me {aqui.}\\nEntão, disse: Não estendas a tua mão sobre o moço e não lhe faças nada; porquanto agora sei que temes a Deus e não me negaste o teu filho, o teu único.\\nEntão, levantou Abraão os seus olhos e olhou, e eis um carneiro detrás {dele,} travado pelas suas pontas num mato; e foi Abraão, e tomou o carneiro, e ofereceu-o em holocausto, em lugar de seu filho.\\nE chamou Abraão o nome daquele lugar o {Heb. JEOVÁ Jire} SENHOR proverá; donde se diz {até} ao dia de hoje: No monte do SENHOR se proverá.\\nEntão, o Anjo do SENHOR bradou a Abraão pela segunda vez desde os céus\\ne disse: Por mim mesmo, jurei, diz o SENHOR, porquanto fizeste esta ação e não me negaste o teu filho, o teu único,\\nque deveras te abençoarei e grandissimamente multiplicarei a tua semente como as estrelas dos céus e como a areia que {está} na praia do mar; e a tua semente possuirá a porta dos seus inimigos.\\nE em tua semente serão benditas todas as nações da terra, porquanto obedeceste à minha voz.\\nEntão, Abraão tornou aos seus moços, e levantaram-se e foram juntos para Berseba; e Abraão habitou em Berseba.\\nE sucedeu, depois destas coisas, que anunciaram a Abraão, dizendo: Eis que também Milca deu filhos a Naor, teu irmão:\\nUz, o seu primogênito, e Buz, seu irmão, e Quemuel, pai de Arã,\\ne Quésede, e Hazo, e Pildas, e Jidlafe, e Betuel.\\nE Betuel gerou Rebeca. Estes oito deu Milca a Naor, irmão de Abraão.\\nE a sua concubina, cujo nome {era} Reumá, lhe deu também Teba, e Gaã, e Taás, e Maaca.\\nE foi a vida de Sara cento e vinte e sete anos; {estes foram} os anos da vida de Sara.\\nE morreu Sara em Quiriate-Arba, que é Hebrom, na terra de Canaã; e veio Abraão lamentar a Sara e chorar por ela.\\nDepois, se levantou Abraão de diante do seu morto e falou aos filhos de Hete, dizendo:\\nEstrangeiro e peregrino sou entre vós; dai-me possessão de sepultura convosco, para que eu sepulte o meu morto de diante da minha face.\\nE responderam os filhos de Hete a Abraão, dizendo-lhe:\\nOuve-nos, meu senhor: príncipe de Deus {és} no meio de nós; enterra o teu morto na {mais} escolhida de nossas sepulturas; nenhum de nós te vedará a sua sepultura, para enterrares o teu morto.\\nEntão, se levantou Abraão e inclinou-se diante do povo da terra, diante dos filhos de Hete.\\nE falou com eles, dizendo: Se é de vossa vontade que eu sepulte o meu morto de diante de minha face, ouvi-me e falai por mim a Efrom, filho de Zoar.\\nQue ele me dê a cova de Macpela, que {tem} no fim do seu campo; que ma dê pelo devido preço em posse de sepulcro no meio de vós.\\nOra, Efrom estava no meio dos filhos de Hete; e respondeu Efrom, heteu, a Abraão, aos ouvidos dos filhos de Hete, de todos os que entravam pela porta da sua cidade, dizendo:\\nNão, meu senhor; ouve-me: o campo te dou, também te dou a cova que nele {está;} diante dos olhos dos filhos do meu povo ta dou; sepulta o teu morto.\\nEntão, Abraão se inclinou diante da face do povo da terra\\ne falou a Efrom, aos ouvidos do povo da terra, dizendo: Mas, se tu estás {por isto,} ouve-me, peço-te: o preço do campo {o} darei; toma-o de mim, e sepultarei ali o meu morto.\\nE respondeu Efrom a Abraão, dizendo-lhe:\\nMeu senhor, ouve-me: a terra {é} de quatrocentos siclos de prata; que é isto entre mim e ti? Sepulta o teu morto.\\nE Abraão deu ouvidos a Efrom e Abraão pesou a Efrom a prata de que tinha falado aos ouvidos dos filhos de Hete, quatrocentos siclos de prata, correntes entre mercadores.\\nAssim, o campo de Efrom, que {estava} em Macpela, em frente de Manre, o campo e a cova que nele {estava,} e todo o arvoredo que no campo {havia,} que {estava} em todo o seu contorno ao redor,\\nse confirmaram a Abraão em possessão diante dos olhos dos filhos de Hete, de todos os que entravam pela porta da sua cidade.\\nE, depois, sepultou Abraão a Sara, sua mulher, na cova do campo de Macpela, em frente de Manre, que é Hebrom, na terra de Canaã.\\nAssim, o campo e a cova que nele {estava} se confirmaram a Abraão, em possessão de sepultura pelos filhos de Hete.\\nE era Abraão já velho {e} adiantado em idade, e o SENHOR havia abençoado a Abraão em tudo.\\nE disse Abraão ao seu servo, o mais velho da casa, que tinha o governo sobre tudo o que possuía: Põe agora a tua mão debaixo da minha coxa,\\npara que eu te faça jurar pelo SENHOR, Deus dos céus e Deus da terra, que não tomarás para meu filho mulher das filhas dos cananeus, no meio dos quais eu habito,\\nmas que irás à minha terra e à minha parentela e {daí} tomarás mulher para meu filho Isaque.\\nE disse-lhe o servo: Porventura não quererá seguir-me a mulher a esta terra. Farei, pois, tornar o teu filho à terra de onde saíste?\\nE Abraão lhe disse: Guarda-te, que não faças lá tornar o meu filho.\\nO SENHOR, Deus dos céus, que me tomou da casa de meu pai e da terra da minha parentela, e que me falou, e que me jurou, dizendo: À tua semente darei esta terra, ele enviará o seu Anjo adiante da tua face, para que tomes mulher de lá para meu filho.\\nSe a mulher, porém, não quiser seguir-te, serás livre deste meu juramento; somente não faças lá tornar a meu filho.\\nEntão, pôs o servo a sua mão debaixo da coxa de Abraão, seu senhor, e jurou-lhe sobre este negócio.\\nE o servo tomou dez camelos, dos camelos do seu senhor, e partiu, pois que toda a fazenda de seu senhor {estava} em sua mão; e levantou-se e partiu para a Mesopotâmia, {que é Síria dos dois rios} para a cidade de Naor.\\nE fez ajoelhar os camelos fora da cidade, junto a um poço de água, pela tarde, ao tempo em que as moças saíam a tirar {água.}\\nE disse: Ó SENHOR, Deus de meu senhor Abraão, dá-me, hoje, bom encontro e faze beneficência ao meu senhor Abraão!\\nEis que eu estou em pé junto à fonte de água, e as filhas dos varões desta cidade saem para tirar água;\\nSeja, pois, que a donzela a quem eu disser: abaixa agora o teu cântaro para que eu beba; e ela disser: Bebe, e também darei de beber aos teus camelos, esta {seja} a quem designaste ao teu servo Isaque; e que eu conheça nisso que fizeste beneficência a meu senhor.\\nE sucedeu que, antes que ele acabasse de falar, eis que Rebeca, que havia nascido a Betuel, filho de Milca, mulher de Naor, irmão de Abraão, saía com o seu cântaro sobre o seu ombro.\\nE a donzela {era} mui formosa à vista, virgem, a quem varão não havia conhecido; e desceu à fonte, e encheu o seu cântaro, e subiu.\\nEntão, o servo correu-lhe ao encontro e disse: Ora, deixa-me beber um pouco de água do teu cântaro.\\nE ela disse: Bebe, meu senhor. E apressou-se, e abaixou o seu cântaro sobre a sua mão, e deu-lhe de beber.\\nE, acabando ela de lhe dar de beber, disse: Tirarei também {água} para os teus camelos, até que acabem de beber.\\nE apressou-se, e vazou o seu cântaro na pia, e correu outra vez ao poço para tirar {água,} e tirou para todos os seus camelos.\\nE o varão estava admirado de vê-la, calando-se, para saber se o SENHOR havia prosperado a sua jornada ou não.\\nE aconteceu que, acabando os camelos de beber, tomou o varão um pendente de ouro de meio siclo de peso e duas pulseiras para as suas mãos, do peso de dez {siclos} de ouro,\\ne disse: De quem {és} filha? Faze-mo saber, peço-te; há também em casa de teu pai lugar para nós pousarmos?\\nE ela disse: Eu {sou} filha de Betuel, filho de Milca, o qual ela deu a Naor.\\nDisse-lhe mais: Também temos palha, e muito pasto, e lugar para passar a noite.\\nEntão, inclinou-se aquele varão, e adorou ao SENHOR,\\ne disse: Bendito {seja} o SENHOR, Deus de meu senhor Abraão, que não retirou a sua beneficência e a sua verdade de meu senhor; quanto a mim, o SENHOR me guiou no caminho à casa dos irmãos de meu senhor.\\nE a donzela correu e fez saber estas coisas na casa de sua mãe.\\nE Rebeca tinha um irmão cujo nome {era} Labão; e Labão correu ao encontro daquele varão à fonte.\\nE aconteceu que, quando ele viu o pendente e as pulseiras sobre as mãos de sua irmã e quando ouviu as palavras de sua irmã Rebeca, que dizia: Assim me falou aquele varão, veio ao varão, e eis que estava em pé junto aos camelos, junto à fonte.\\nE disse: Entra, bendito do SENHOR, por que estarás fora? Pois eu já preparei a casa e o lugar para os camelos.\\nEntão, veio aquele varão à casa, e desataram os camelos e deram palha e pasto aos camelos e água para lavar os pés dele e os pés dos varões que {estavam} com ele.\\nDepois, puseram de comer diante dele. Ele, porém, disse: Não comerei, até que tenha dito as minhas palavras. E ele disse: Fala.\\nEntão, disse: Eu {sou} o servo de Abraão.\\nO SENHOR abençoou muito o meu senhor, de maneira que foi engrandecido; e deu-lhe ovelhas e vacas, e prata e ouro, e servos e servas, e camelos e jumentos.\\nE Sara, a mulher do meu senhor, gerou um filho a meu senhor depois da sua velhice; e ele deu-lhe tudo quanto tem.\\nE meu senhor me fez jurar, dizendo: Não tomarás mulher para meu filho das filhas dos cananeus, em cuja terra habito;\\nirás, porém, à casa de meu pai e à minha família e tomarás mulher para meu filho.\\nEntão, disse eu ao meu senhor: Porventura não me seguirá a mulher.\\nE {ele} me disse: O SENHOR, em cuja presença tenho andado, enviará o seu Anjo contigo e prosperará o teu caminho, para que tomes mulher para meu filho da minha família e da casa de meu pai.\\nEntão, serás livre do meu juramento, quando fores à minha família; e, se não ta derem, livre serás do meu juramento.\\nE hoje cheguei à fonte e disse: Ó SENHOR, Deus de meu senhor Abraão, se tu, agora, prosperas o meu caminho, no qual eu ando,\\neis que estou junto à fonte de água; seja, pois, que a donzela que sair para tirar {água} e à qual eu disser: Ora, dá-me um pouco de água do teu cântaro,\\ne ela me disser: Bebe tu também e também tirarei água para os teus camelos, esta {seja} a mulher que o SENHOR designou ao filho de meu senhor.\\nE, antes que eu acabasse de falar no meu coração, eis que Rebeca saía com seu cântaro sobre o seu ombro, e desceu à fonte, e tirou {água;} e eu lhe disse: Ora, dá-me de beber.\\nE ela se apressou, e abaixou o seu cântaro de sobre si, e disse: Bebe, e também darei de beber aos teus camelos; e bebi, e ela deu também de beber aos camelos.\\nEntão, lhe perguntei e disse: De quem {és} filha? E ela disse: Filha de Betuel, filho de Naor, que lhe gerou Milca. Então, eu pus o pendente no seu rosto e as pulseiras sobre as suas mãos.\\nE, inclinando-me, adorei ao SENHOR e bendisse ao SENHOR, Deus do meu senhor Abraão, que me havia encaminhado pelo caminho da verdade, para tomar a filha do irmão de meu senhor para seu filho.\\nAgora, pois, se vós haveis de mostrar beneficência e verdade a meu senhor, fazei-mo saber; e, se não, {também} mo fazei saber, para que eu olhe à mão direita ou à esquerda.\\nEntão, responderam Labão e Betuel e disseram: Do SENHOR procedeu este negócio; não podemos falar-te mal ou bem.\\nEis que Rebeca {está} diante da tua face; toma-a e vai-te; seja a mulher do filho de teu senhor, como tem dito o SENHOR.\\nE aconteceu que o servo de Abraão, ouvindo as suas palavras, inclinou-se à terra diante do SENHOR;\\ne tirou o servo vasos {ou jóias} de prata, e vasos de ouro, e vestes e deu-os a Rebeca; também deu coisas preciosas a seu irmão e a sua mãe.\\nEntão, comeram, e beberam, ele e os varões que com ele estavam, e passaram a noite. E levantaram-se pela manhã, e disse: Deixai-me ir a meu senhor.\\nEntão, disseram seu irmão e sua mãe: Fique a donzela conosco {alguns} dias ou pelo menos dez dias; e depois irá.\\nEle, porém, lhes disse: Não me detenhais, pois o SENHOR tem prosperado o meu caminho; deixai-me partir, para que eu volte a meu senhor.\\nE disseram: Chamemos a donzela e perguntemos-lho.\\nE chamaram Rebeca e disseram-lhe: Irás tu com este varão? Ela respondeu: Irei.\\nEntão, despediram Rebeca, sua irmã, e a sua ama, e o servo de Abraão, e os seus varões.\\nE abençoaram Rebeca e disseram-lhe: Ó nossa irmã, sejas tu em milhares de milhares, e que a tua semente possua a porta de seus aborrecedores!\\nE Rebeca se levantou com as suas moças, e subiram sobre os camelos e seguiram o varão; e tomou aquele servo a Rebeca e partiu.\\nOra, Isaque vinha do caminho do poço de Laai-Roi, porque habitava na terra do Sul.\\nE Isaque saíra a orar {ou meditar} no campo, sobre a tarde; e levantou os olhos, e olhou e eis que os camelos vinham.\\nRebeca também levantou os olhos, e viu a Isaque, e lançou-se do camelo,\\ne disse ao servo: Quem {é} aquele varão que vem pelo campo ao nosso encontro? E o servo disse: Este {é} meu senhor. Então, tomou ela o véu e cobriu-se.\\nE o servo contou a Isaque todas as coisas que fizera.\\nE Isaque trouxe-a para a tenda de sua mãe, Sara, e tomou a Rebeca, e foi-lhe por mulher, e amou-a. Assim, Isaque foi consolado depois da {morte} de sua mãe.\\nE Abraão tomou {outra} mulher; o seu nome {era} Quetura.\\nE gerou-lhe Zinrã, e Jocsã, e Medã, e Midiã, e Isbaque, e Suá.\\nE Jocsã gerou a Seba e a Dedã; e os filhos de Dedã foram Assurim, e Letusim, e Leumim.\\nE os filhos de Midiã foram Efá, e Efer, e Enoque, e Abida, e Elda; estes todos {foram} filhos de Quetura.\\nPorém Abraão deu tudo o que tinha a Isaque.\\nMas, aos filhos das concubinas que Abraão tinha, deu Abraão presentes e, vivendo ele ainda, despediu-os do seu filho Isaque, ao Oriente, para a terra oriental.\\nEstes, pois, {são} os dias dos anos da vida de Abraão, que viveu cento e setenta e cinco anos.\\nE Abraão expirou e morreu em boa velhice, velho e farto {de dias;} e foi congregado ao seu povo.\\nE sepultaram-no Isaque e Ismael, seus filhos, na cova de Macpela, no campo de Efrom, filho de Zoar, heteu, que {estava} em frente de Manre,\\no campo que Abraão comprara aos filhos de Hete. Ali está sepultado Abraão e Sara, sua mulher.\\nE aconteceu, depois da morte de Abraão, que Deus abençoou a Isaque, seu filho; e habitava Isaque junto ao poço Laai-Roi.\\nEstas, porém, são as gerações de Ismael, filho de Abraão, que a serva de Sara, Agar, egípcia, deu a Abraão.\\nE estes são os nomes dos filhos de Ismael pelos seus nomes, segundo as suas gerações: o primogênito de Ismael {era} Nebaiote, depois Quedar, e Abdeel, e Mibsão,\\ne Misma, e Dumá, e Massá,\\ne Hadade, e Tema, e Jetur, e Nafis, e Quedemá.\\nEstes {são} os filhos de Ismael, e estes {são} os seus nomes pelas suas vilas e pelos seus castelos: {ou acampamentos} doze príncipes segundo as suas famílias. {ou nações}\\nE estes {são} os anos da vida de Ismael, {que viveu} cento e trinta e sete anos; e ele expirou, e morreu, e foi congregado ao seu povo.\\nE habitaram desde Havilá até Sur, que {está} em frente do Egito, indo para Assur; {ou Assíria} e {Ismael} fez o seu assento diante da face de todos os seus irmãos.\\nE estas {são} as gerações de Isaque, filho de Abraão: Abraão gerou a Isaque;\\ne era Isaque da idade de quarenta anos, quando tomou a Rebeca, filha de Betuel, arameu {ou siro} de Padã-Arã, irmã de Labão, arameu, por sua mulher.\\nE Isaque orou instantemente ao SENHOR por sua mulher, porquanto {era} estéril; e o SENHOR ouviu as suas orações, e Rebeca, sua mulher, concebeu.\\nE os filhos lutavam dentro dela; então, disse: Se assim {é,} por que {sou} eu {assim?} E foi-se a perguntar ao SENHOR.\\nE o SENHOR lhe disse: Duas nações {há} no teu ventre, e dois povos se dividirão das tuas entranhas: {um} povo será mais forte do que o {outro} povo, e o maior servirá ao menor.\\nE, cumprindo-se os seus dias para dar à luz, eis gêmeos no seu ventre.\\nE saiu o primeiro, ruivo e todo como uma veste cabeluda; por isso, chamaram o seu nome Esaú. {que significa cabeludo}\\nE, depois, saiu o seu irmão, agarrada sua mão ao calcanhar de Esaú; por isso, se chamou o seu nome Jacó. {que significa suplantador} E {era} Isaque da idade de sessenta anos quando os gerou.\\nE cresceram os meninos. E Esaú foi varão perito na caça, varão do campo; mas Jacó {era} varão simples, habitando em tendas.\\nE amava Isaque a Esaú, porque a caça era de seu gosto; mas Rebeca amava a Jacó.\\nE Jacó cozera um guisado; e veio Esaú do campo e {estava} ele cansado. {ou desfalecido}\\nE disse Esaú a Jacó: Deixa-me, peço-te, comer desse {guisado} vermelho, porque estou cansado. Por isso, se chamou o seu nome Edom. {que significa vermelho}\\nEntão, disse Jacó: Vende-me, hoje, a tua primogenitura.\\nE disse Esaú: Eis que estou a ponto de morrer, e para que me {servirá} logo a primogenitura?\\nEntão, disse Jacó: Jura-me hoje. E jurou-lhe e vendeu a sua primogenitura a Jacó.\\nE Jacó deu pão a Esaú e o guisado das lentilhas; e ele comeu, e bebeu, e levantou-se, e foi-se. Assim, desprezou Esaú a {sua} primogenitura.\\nE havia fome na terra, além da primeira fome, que foi nos dias de Abraão; por isso, foi-se Isaque a Abimeleque, rei dos filisteus, em Gerar.\\nE apareceu-lhe o SENHOR e disse: Não desças ao Egito. Habita na terra que eu te disser;\\nperegrina nesta terra, e serei contigo e te abençoarei; porque a ti e à tua semente darei todas estas terras e confirmarei o juramento que tenho jurado a Abraão, teu pai.\\nE multiplicarei a tua semente como as estrelas dos céus e darei à tua semente todas estas terras. E em tua semente serão benditas todas as nações da terra,\\nporquanto Abraão obedeceu à minha voz e guardou o meu mandado, os meus preceitos, os meus estatutos e as minhas leis.\\nAssim, habitou Isaque em Gerar.\\nE, perguntando-lhe os varões daquele lugar acerca de sua mulher, disse: {É} minha irmã; porque temia dizer: {É} minha mulher; para que porventura {dizia ele} me não matem os varões daquele lugar por amor de Rebeca; porque {era} formosa à vista.\\nE aconteceu que, como ele esteve ali muito tempo, Abimeleque, rei dos filisteus, olhou por uma janela e viu, e eis que Isaque {estava} brincando com Rebeca, sua mulher.\\nEntão, chamou Abimeleque a Isaque e disse: Eis que, na verdade, {é} tua mulher; como, pois, disseste: {É} minha irmã? E disse-lhe Isaque: Porque eu dizia: Para que eu porventura não morra por causa dela.\\nE disse Abimeleque: Que {é} isto {que} nos fizeste? Facilmente se teria deitado alguém deste povo com a tua mulher, e tu terias trazido sobre nós um delito.\\nE mandou Abimeleque a todo o povo, dizendo: Qualquer que tocar neste varão ou em sua mulher certamente morrerá.\\nE semeou Isaque naquela mesma terra e colheu, naquele mesmo ano, cem {ou o cêntuplo} medidas, porque o SENHOR o abençoava.\\nE engrandeceu-se o varão e ia-se engrandecendo, até que se tornou mui grande;\\ne tinha possessão de ovelhas, e possessão de vacas, e muita gente de serviço, de maneira que os filisteus o invejavam.\\nE todos os poços que os servos de seu pai tinham cavado nos dias de Abraão, seu pai, os filisteus entulharam e encheram de terra.\\nDisse também Abimeleque a Isaque: Aparta-te de nós, porque muito mais poderoso te tens feito do que nós.\\nEntão, Isaque foi-se dali, e fez o seu assento no vale de Gerar, e habitou lá.\\nE tornou Isaque, e cavou os poços de água que cavaram nos dias de Abraão, seu pai, e que os filisteus taparam depois da morte de Abraão, e chamou-os pelos nomes que os chamara seu pai.\\nCavaram, pois, os servos de Isaque naquele vale e acharam ali um poço de águas vivas.\\nE os pastores de Gerar porfiaram com os pastores de Isaque, dizendo: Esta água {é} nossa. Por isso, chamou o nome daquele poço Eseque, {que significa contenda} porque contenderam com ele.\\nEntão, cavaram outro poço e também porfiaram sobre ele. Por isso, chamou o seu nome Sitna. {que significa inimizade}\\nE partiu dali e cavou outro poço; e não porfiaram sobre ele. Por isso, chamou o seu nome Reobote {que significa alargamento} e disse: Porque agora nos alargou o SENHOR, e crescemos nesta terra.\\nDepois, subiu dali a Berseba,\\ne apareceu-lhe o SENHOR naquela mesma noite e disse: Eu {sou} o Deus de Abraão, teu pai. Não temas, porque eu {sou} contigo, e abençoar-te-ei, e multiplicarei a tua semente por amor de Abraão, meu servo.\\nEntão, edificou ali um altar, e invocou o nome do SENHOR, e armou ali a sua tenda; e os servos de Isaque cavaram ali um poço.\\nE Abimeleque veio a ele de Gerar, com Ausate, seu amigo, e Ficol, príncipe {ou capitão-mor} do seu exército.\\nE disse-lhe Isaque: Por que viestes a mim, pois que vós me aborreceis e me enviastes de vós?\\nE eles disseram: Havemos visto, na verdade, que o SENHOR é contigo; pelo que dissemos: Haja, agora, juramento entre nós, entre nós e ti; e façamos concerto contigo.\\nQue nos não faças mal, como nós te não temos tocado, e como te fizemos somente bem, e te deixamos ir em paz. Agora, tu {és} o bendito do SENHOR.\\nEntão, lhes fez um banquete, e comeram e beberam.\\nE levantaram-se de madrugada e juraram um ao outro; depois, os despediu Isaque, e despediram-se dele, em paz.\\nE aconteceu, naquele mesmo dia, que vieram os servos de Isaque, e anunciaram-lhe acerca do negócio do poço, que tinham cavado, e disseram-lhe: Temos achado água.\\nE chamou-o Seba. {que significa juramento} Por isso, {é} o nome daquela cidade Berseba {Heb. Beer-Seba, que significa poço do juramento} até o dia de hoje.\\nOra, sendo Esaú da idade de quarenta anos, tomou por mulher a Judite, filha de Beeri, heteu, e a Basemate, filha de Elom, heteu.\\nE {estas} foram para Isaque e Rebeca uma amargura de espírito.\\nE aconteceu que, como Isaque envelheceu, e os seus olhos se escureceram, de maneira que não podia ver, chamou a Esaú, seu filho mais velho, e disse-lhe: Meu filho! E ele lhe disse: Eis-me {aqui!}\\nE ele disse: Eis que já agora estou velho e não sei o dia da minha morte.\\nAgora, pois, toma as tuas armas, a tua aljava e o teu arco, e sai ao campo, e apanha para mim {alguma} caça,\\ne faze-me um guisado saboroso, como eu gosto, e traze-mo, para que eu coma, e para que minha alma te abençoe, antes que morra.\\nE Rebeca escutou quando Isaque falava ao seu filho Esaú; e foi-se Esaú ao campo, para apanhar caça que havia de trazer.\\nEntão, falou Rebeca a Jacó, seu filho, dizendo: Eis que tenho ouvido o teu pai que falava com Esaú, teu irmão, dizendo:\\nTraze-me caça e faze-me um guisado saboroso, para que eu coma e te abençoe diante da face do SENHOR, antes da minha morte.\\nAgora, pois, filho meu, ouve a minha voz naquilo que eu te mando.\\nVai, agora, ao rebanho e traze-me de lá dois bons cabritos; e eu farei deles um guisado saboroso para teu pai, como ele gosta;\\ne levá-lo-ás a teu pai, para que o coma e para que te abençoe antes da sua morte.\\nEntão, disse Jacó a Rebeca, sua mãe: Eis que Esaú, meu irmão, {é} varão cabeludo, e eu, varão liso.\\nPorventura, me apalpará o meu pai, e serei, a seus olhos, enganador; assim, trarei eu sobre mim maldição e não bênção.\\nE disse-lhe sua mãe: Meu filho, sobre mim {seja} a tua maldição; somente obedece à minha voz, e vai, e traze-m{os.}\\nE foi, e tomou-os, e trouxe-os à sua mãe; e sua mãe fez um guisado saboroso, como seu pai gostava.\\nDepois, tomou Rebeca as vestes {ou vestes preciosas} de gala de Esaú, seu filho mais velho, que {tinha} consigo em casa, e vestiu a Jacó, seu filho menor.\\nE, com as peles dos cabritos, cobriu as suas mãos e a lisura do seu pescoço\\ne deu o guisado saboroso e o pão que tinha preparado na mão de Jacó, seu filho.\\nE veio ele a seu pai e disse: Meu pai! E ele disse: Eis-me {aqui.} Quem {és} tu, meu filho?\\nE Jacó disse a seu pai: Eu {sou} Esaú, teu primogênito. Tenho feito como me disseste. Levanta-te agora, assenta-te e come da minha caça, para que a tua alma me abençoe.\\nEntão, disse Isaque a seu filho: Como {é isto, que} tão cedo {a} achaste, filho meu? E ele disse: Porque o SENHOR, teu Deus, {a} mandou ao meu encontro.\\nE disse Isaque a Jacó: Chega-te agora, para que te apalpe, meu filho, se {és} meu filho Esaú mesmo ou não.\\nEntão, se chegou Jacó a Isaque, seu pai, que o apalpou e disse: A voz {é} a voz de Jacó, porém as mãos {são} as mãos de Esaú.\\nE não o conheceu, porquanto as suas mãos estavam cabeludas, como as mãos de Esaú, seu irmão. E abençoou-o.\\nE disse: {És} tu meu filho Esaú mesmo? E ele disse: Eu {sou.}\\nEntão, disse: Faze chegar isso perto de mim, para que coma da caça de meu filho; para que a minha alma te abençoe. E chegou-lho, e comeu; trouxe-lhe também vinho, e bebeu.\\nE disse-lhe Isaque, seu pai: Ora, chega-te e beija-me, filho meu.\\nE chegou-se e beijou-o. Então, cheirou o cheiro das suas vestes, e abençoou-o, e disse: Eis que o cheiro do meu filho {é} como o cheiro do campo, que o SENHOR abençoou.\\nAssim, pois, te dê Deus do orvalho dos céus, e das gorduras da terra, e abundância de trigo e de mosto.\\nSirvam-te povos, e nações se encurvem a ti; sê senhor de teus irmãos, e os filhos da tua mãe se encurvem a ti; malditos {sejam} os que te amaldiçoarem, e benditos {sejam} os que te abençoarem.\\nE aconteceu que, acabando Isaque de abençoar a Jacó, apenas Jacó acabava de sair da face de Isaque, seu pai, veio Esaú, seu irmão, da sua caça.\\nE fez também ele um guisado saboroso, e trouxe-o a seu pai, e disse a seu pai: Levanta-te, meu pai, e come da caça de teu filho, para que me abençoe a tua alma.\\nE disse-lhe Isaque, seu pai: Quem {és} tu? E ele disse: Eu sou teu filho, o teu primogênito, Esaú.\\nEntão, estremeceu Isaque de um estremecimento muito grande e disse: Quem, pois, {é} aquele que apanhou a caça e {ma} trouxe? Eu comi de tudo, antes que tu viesses, e abençoei-o; também será bendito.\\nEsaú, ouvindo as palavras de seu pai, bradou com grande e mui amargo brado e disse a seu pai: Abençoa-me também a mim, meu pai.\\nE ele disse: Veio o teu irmão com sutileza e tomou a tua bênção.\\nEntão, disse ele: Não foi o seu nome {justamente} chamado Jacó? Por isso, que já duas vezes me enganou: a minha primogenitura {me} tomou e eis que agora {me} tomou a minha bênção. E disse mais: Não reservaste, pois, para mim bênção alguma?\\nEntão, respondeu Isaque e disse a Esaú: Eis que o tenho posto por senhor sobre ti, e todos os seus irmãos lhe tenho dado por servos; e de trigo e de mosto o tenho fortalecido; que te farei, pois, agora {a ti,} meu filho?\\nE disse Esaú a seu pai: Tens uma só bênção, meu pai? Abençoa-me também a mim, meu pai. E levantou Esaú a sua voz e chorou.\\nEntão, respondeu Isaque, seu pai, e disse-lhe: Eis que a tua habitação será longe das gorduras da terra e sem orvalho dos céus.\\nE pela tua espada viverás e ao teu irmão servirás. Acontecerá, porém, que, quando te libertares, então, sacudirás o seu jugo do teu pescoço.\\nE aborreceu Esaú a Jacó por causa daquela bênção, com que seu pai o tinha abençoado; e Esaú disse no seu coração: Chegar-se-ão os dias de luto de meu pai; então, matarei a Jacó, meu irmão.\\nE foram denunciadas a Rebeca estas palavras de Esaú, seu filho mais velho; e ela enviou, e chamou a Jacó, seu filho menor, e disse-lhe: Eis que Esaú, teu irmão, se consola a teu respeito, {propondo-se} matar-te.\\nAgora, pois, meu filho, ouve a minha voz: levanta-te e acolhe-te a Labão, meu irmão, em Harã;\\ne mora com ele alguns dias, até que passe o furor de teu irmão,\\naté que se desvie de ti a ira de teu irmão, e se esqueça do que lhe fizeste. Então, enviarei e te farei vir de lá. Por que seria eu desfilhada também de vós ambos num mesmo dia?\\nE disse Rebeca a Isaque: Enfadada estou da minha vida, por causa das filhas de Hete; se Jacó tomar mulher das filhas de Hete, como estas {são} das filhas desta terra, para que me {será} a vida?\\nE Isaque chamou a Jacó, e abençoou-o, e ordenou-lhe, e disse-lhe: Não tomes mulher de entre as filhas de Canaã.\\nLevanta-te, vai a Padã-Arã, à casa de Betuel, pai de tua mãe, e toma de lá uma mulher das filhas de Labão, irmão de tua mãe.\\nE Deus Todo-poderoso te abençoe, e te faça frutificar, e te multiplique, para que sejas uma multidão de povos;\\ne te dê a bênção de Abraão, a ti e à tua semente contigo, para que em herança possuas a terra de tuas peregrinações, que Deus deu a Abraão.\\nAssim, enviou Isaque a Jacó, o qual se foi a Padã-Arã, a Labão, filho de Betuel, arameu, {ou siro} irmão de Rebeca, mãe de Jacó e de Esaú.\\nVendo, pois, Esaú que Isaque abençoara a Jacó, e o enviara a Padã-Arã, para tomar mulher para si dali, {e} que, abençoando-o, lhe ordenara, dizendo: Não tomes mulher das filhas de Canaã;\\ne que Jacó obedecera a seu pai e a sua mãe e se fora a Padã-Arã;\\nvendo também Esaú que as filhas de Canaã eram más aos olhos de Isaque, seu pai,\\nfoi-se Esaú a Ismael e tomou para si por mulher, além das suas mulheres, a Maalate, filha de Ismael, filho de Abraão, e irmã de Nebaiote.\\nPartiu, pois, Jacó de Berseba, e foi-se a Harã.\\nE chegou a um lugar onde passou a noite, porque já o sol era posto; e tomou uma das pedras daquele lugar, e {a} pôs por sua cabeceira, e deitou-se naquele lugar.\\nE sonhou: e eis {era} posta na terra uma escada cujo topo tocava nos céus; e eis que os anjos de Deus subiam e desciam por ela.\\nE eis que o SENHOR estava em cima dela e disse: Eu {sou} o SENHOR, o Deus de Abraão, teu pai, e o Deus de Isaque. Esta terra em que {estás} deitado ta darei a ti e à tua semente.\\nE a tua semente será como o pó da terra; e estender-se-á ao ocidente, e ao oriente, e ao norte, e ao sul; e em ti e na tua semente serão benditas todas as famílias da terra.\\nE eis que {estou} contigo, e te guardarei por onde quer que fores, e te farei tornar a esta terra, porque te não deixarei, até que te haja feito o que te tenho dito.\\nAcordado, pois, Jacó do seu sono, disse: Na verdade o SENHOR está neste lugar, e eu não o sabia.\\nE temeu e disse: Quão terrível {é} este lugar! Este não {é outro lugar} senão a Casa de Deus; e esta {é} a porta dos céus.\\nEntão, levantou-se Jacó pela manhã, de madrugada, e tomou a pedra que tinha posto por sua cabeceira, e a pôs por coluna, e derramou azeite em cima dela.\\nE chamou o nome daquele lugar Betel; {que significa Casa de Deus} o nome, porém, daquela cidade, dantes, {era} Luz.\\nE Jacó fez um voto, dizendo: Se Deus for comigo, e me guardar nesta viagem que faço, e me der pão para comer e vestes para vestir,\\ne eu em paz tornar à casa de meu pai, o SENHOR será o meu Deus;\\ne esta pedra, que tenho posto por coluna, será Casa de Deus; e, de tudo quanto me deres, certamente te darei o dízimo.\\nEntão, pôs-se Jacó a pé e foi-se à terra dos filhos do Oriente.\\nE olhou, e eis um poço no campo, e eis três rebanhos de ovelhas que estavam deitados junto a ele; porque daquele poço davam de beber aos rebanhos; e {havia} uma grande pedra sobre a boca do poço.\\nE ajuntavam ali todos os rebanhos, e removiam a pedra de sobre a boca do poço, e davam de beber às ovelhas, e tornavam {a pôr} a pedra sobre a boca do poço, no seu lugar.\\nE disse-lhes Jacó: Meus irmãos, donde {sois?} E disseram: {Somos} de Harã.\\nE ele lhes disse: Conheceis a Labão, filho de Naor? E disseram: Conhecemos.\\nDisse-lhes mais: Está ele bem? E disseram: Está bem, e eis aqui Raquel, sua filha, que vem com as ovelhas.\\nE ele disse: Eis que ainda é muito dia, não {é} tempo de ajuntar o gado; dai de beber às ovelhas, e ide, e apascentai-{as.}\\nE disseram: Não podemos, até que todos os rebanhos se ajuntem, e removam a pedra de sobre a boca do poço, para que demos de beber às ovelhas.\\n{Estando} ele ainda falando com eles, veio Raquel com as ovelhas de seu pai; porque ela {era} pastora.\\nE aconteceu que, vendo Jacó a Raquel, filha de Labão, irmão de sua mãe, e as ovelhas de Labão, irmão de sua mãe, chegou Jacó, e revolveu a pedra de sobre a boca do poço, e deu de beber às ovelhas de Labão, irmão de sua mãe.\\nE Jacó beijou a Raquel, e levantou a sua voz, e chorou.\\nE Jacó anunciou a Raquel que {era} irmão de seu pai e que {era} filho de Rebeca. Então, ela correu e o anunciou a seu pai.\\nE aconteceu que, ouvindo Labão as novas de Jacó, filho de sua irmã, correu-lhe ao encontro, e abraçou-o, e beijou-o, e levou-o à sua casa. E contou ele a Labão todas estas coisas.\\nEntão, Labão disse-lhe: Verdadeiramente {és} tu o meu osso e a minha carne. E ficou com ele um mês inteiro.\\nDepois, disse Labão a Jacó: Porque tu {és} meu irmão, hás de servir-me de graça? Declara-me qual {será} o teu salário.\\nE Labão tinha duas filhas; o nome da mais velha {era} Léia, e o nome da menor, Raquel.\\nLéia, porém, {tinha} olhos tenros, {ou enfermos} mas Raquel era de formoso semblante e formosa à vista.\\nE Jacó amava a Raquel e disse: Sete anos te servirei por Raquel, tua filha menor.\\nEntão, disse Labão: Melhor {é} que eu ta dê do que a dê a outro varão; fica comigo.\\nAssim, serviu Jacó sete anos por Raquel; e foram aos seus olhos como poucos dias, pelo muito que a amava.\\nE disse Jacó a Labão: Dá-{me} minha mulher, porque meus dias são cumpridos, para que eu entre a ela.\\nEntão, ajuntou Labão todos os varões daquele lugar e fez um banquete.\\nE aconteceu, à tarde, que tomou Léia, sua filha, e trouxe-lha. E entrou a ela.\\nE Labão deu sua serva Zilpa {por} serva a Léia, sua filha.\\nE aconteceu pela manhã ver que {era} Léia; pelo que disse a Labão: Por que me fizeste isso? Não te tenho servido por Raquel? Por que, pois, me enganaste?\\nE disse Labão: Não se faz assim no nosso lugar, que a menor se dê antes da primogênita.\\nCumpre a semana desta; então te daremos também a outra, pelo serviço que ainda outros sete anos servires comigo.\\nE Jacó fez assim e cumpriu a semana desta; então, lhe deu por mulher Raquel, sua filha.\\nE Labão deu sua serva Bila por serva a Raquel, sua filha.\\nE entrou também a Raquel e amou também a Raquel mais do que a Léia; e serviu com ele ainda outros sete anos.\\nVendo, pois, o SENHOR que Léia {era} aborrecida, abriu a sua madre; porém Raquel {era} estéril.\\nE concebeu Léia, e teve um filho, e chamou o seu nome Rúben, {que significa Eis um filho} dizendo: Porque o SENHOR atendeu à minha aflição. Por isso, agora me amará o meu marido.\\nE concebeu outra vez e teve um filho, dizendo: Porquanto o SENHOR ouviu que eu {era} aborrecida, me deu também este; e chamou o seu nome Simeão. {que significa ouvindo}\\nE concebeu outra vez e teve um filho, dizendo: Agora, esta vez se ajuntará meu marido comigo, porque três filhos lhe tenho dado; por isso, chamou o seu nome Levi. {que significa junto}\\nE concebeu outra vez e teve um filho, dizendo: Esta vez louvarei ao SENHOR. Por isso, chamou o seu nome Judá; {que significa louvor} e cessou de ter filhos.\\nVendo, pois, Raquel que não dava filhos a Jacó, teve Raquel inveja de sua irmã e disse a Jacó: Dá-me filhos, senão morro.\\nEntão, se acendeu a ira de Jacó contra Raquel e disse: {Estou} eu no lugar de Deus, que te impediu o fruto de teu ventre?\\nE ela disse: Eis aqui minha serva Bila; entra a ela, para que tenha filhos sobre os meus joelhos, e eu assim receba {ou tenha filhos} filhos por ela.\\nAssim, lhe deu a Bila, sua serva, por mulher; e Jacó entrou a ela.\\nE concebeu Bila e deu a Jacó um filho.\\nEntão, disse Raquel: Julgou-me Deus, e também ouviu a minha voz, e me deu um filho; por isso, chamou o seu nome Dã. {que significa juiz}\\nE Bila, serva de Raquel, concebeu outra vez e deu a Jacó o segundo filho.\\nEntão, disse Raquel: Com lutas de Deus, tenho lutado com minha irmã e também venci; e chamou o seu nome Naftali. {que significa lutando}\\nVendo, pois, Léia que cessava de gerar, tomou também a Zilpa, sua serva, e deu-a a Jacó por mulher.\\nE deu Zilpa, serva de Léia, um filho a Jacó.\\nEntão, disse Léia: Vem {Heb. Vem uma fortuna} uma turba; e chamou o seu nome de Gade. {que significa fortuna}\\nDepois, deu Zilpa, serva de Léia, um segundo filho a Jacó.\\nEntão, disse Léia: Para {Heb. Sou feliz} minha ventura, porque as filhas me terão por bem-aventurada; e chamou o seu nome Aser. {que significa feliz}\\nE foi Rúben, nos dias da sega do trigo, e achou mandrágoras no campo. E trouxe-as a Léia, sua mãe. Então, disse Raquel a Léia: Ora, dá-me das mandrágoras do teu filho.\\nE ela lhe disse: {É já} pouco que hajas tomado o meu marido? Tomarás também as mandrágoras do meu filho? Então, disse Raquel: Por isso, se deitará contigo esta noite pelas mandrágoras de teu filho.\\nVindo, pois, Jacó, à tarde, do campo, saiu-lhe Léia ao encontro e disse: A mim entrarás, porque certamente te aluguei com as mandrágoras do meu filho. E deitou-se com ela aquela noite.\\nE ouviu Deus a Léia, e concebeu e teve um quinto filho.\\nEntão, disse Léia: Deus {me} tem dado o meu galardão, pois tenho dado minha serva ao meu marido. E chamou o seu nome Issacar. {que significa galardão}\\nE Léia concebeu outra vez e deu a Jacó um sexto filho.\\nE disse Léia: Deus me deu a mim uma boa dádiva; desta vez morará o meu marido comigo, porque lhe tenho dado seis filhos. E chamou o seu nome Zebulom. {que significa morada}\\nE, depois, teve uma filha e chamou o seu nome Diná. {que significa julgada}\\nE lembrou-se Deus de Raquel, e Deus a ouviu, e abriu a sua madre.\\nE ela concebeu, e teve um filho, e disse: Tirou-me Deus a minha vergonha.\\nE chamou o seu nome José, {que significa aumentador} dizendo: O SENHOR me acrescente outro filho.\\nE aconteceu que, quando Raquel teve a José, disse Jacó a Labão: Deixa-me ir; que me vá ao meu lugar e à minha terra.\\nDá-{me} os meus filhos e as minhas mulheres, pelas quais te tenho servido, e ir-me-ei; pois tu sabes o meu serviço, que te tenho feito.\\nEntão, lhe disse Labão: Se, agora, tenho achado graça a teus olhos, {fica comigo.} Tenho {Heb. Tenho adivinhado} experimentado que o SENHOR me abençoou por amor de ti.\\nE disse mais: Determina-me o teu salário, que {to} darei.\\nEntão, lhe disse: Tu sabes como te tenho servido e como passou o teu gado comigo.\\nPorque o pouco que tinhas antes de mim é aumentado até uma multidão; e o SENHOR te tem abençoado por meu trabalho. Agora, pois, quando hei de trabalhar também por minha casa?\\nE disse {ele:} Que te darei? Então, disse Jacó: Nada me darás; tornarei a apascentar {e} a guardar o teu rebanho, se me fizeres isto:\\npassarei hoje por todo o teu rebanho, separando dele todos os salpicados e malhados, e todos os morenos entre os cordeiros, e o que é malhado e salpicado entre as cabras; e {isto} será o meu salário.\\nAssim, testificará por mim a minha justiça no dia de amanhã, quando vieres e o meu salário estiver diante de tua face; tudo o que não for salpicado e malhado entre as cabras e moreno entre os cordeiros ser-me-á por furto.\\nEntão, disse Labão: Tomara que seja conforme a tua palavra.\\nE separou, naquele mesmo dia, os bodes listrados e malhados e todas as cabras salpicadas e malhadas, tudo em que {havia} brancura e todo o moreno entre os cordeiros; e deu-os nas mãos dos seus filhos.\\nE pôs três dias de caminho entre si e Jacó; e Jacó apascentava o resto dos rebanhos de Labão.\\nEntão, tomou Jacó varas verdes de álamo, e de aveleira, e de castanheiro e descascou nelas riscas brancas, descobrindo a brancura que nas varas {havia,}\\ne pôs estas varas, que tinha descascado, em frente do rebanho, nos canos e nas pias de água, aonde o rebanho vinha a beber, e conceberam vindo a beber.\\nE concebia o rebanho diante das varas, e as ovelhas davam crias listradas, salpicadas e malhadas.\\nEntão, separou Jacó os cordeiros e pôs as faces do rebanho para os listrados e todo moreno entre o rebanho de Labão; e pôs o seu rebanho à parte e não o pôs com o rebanho de Labão.\\nE sucedia que, cada vez que concebiam as ovelhas fortes, punha Jacó as varas diante dos olhos do rebanho nos canos, para que concebessem diante das varas.\\nMas, quando enfraqueceu o rebanho, não as pôs. Assim, as fracas eram de Labão, e as fortes, de Jacó.\\nE cresceu o varão em grande maneira; e teve muitos rebanhos, e servas, e servos, e camelos, e jumentos.\\nEntão, ouvia as palavras dos filhos de Labão, que diziam: Jacó tem tomado tudo o que {era} de nosso pai e do que {era} de nosso pai fez ele toda esta glória. {ou riqueza}\\nViu também Jacó o rosto de Labão, e eis que não {era} para com ele como dantes.\\nE disse o SENHOR a Jacó: Torna à terra dos teus pais e à tua parentela, e eu serei contigo.\\nEntão, enviou Jacó e chamou a Raquel e a Léia ao campo, ao seu rebanho.\\nE disse-lhes: Vejo que o rosto de vosso pai para comigo não {é} como anteriormente; porém o Deus de meu pai esteve comigo.\\nE vós mesmas sabeis que, com todo o meu poder, tenho servido a vosso pai;\\nmas vosso pai me enganou e mudou o salário dez vezes; porém Deus não lhe permitiu que me fizesse mal.\\nQuando ele dizia assim: Os salpicados serão o teu salário, então, todos os rebanhos davam salpicados. E, quando ele dizia assim: Os listrados serão o teu salário, então, todos os rebanhos davam listrados.\\nAssim, Deus tirou o gado de vosso pai e mo deu a mim.\\nE sucedeu que, ao tempo em que o rebanho concebia, eu levantei os meus olhos e vi em sonhos que os bodes que cobriam as ovelhas {eram} listrados, salpicados e malhados.\\nE disse-me o Anjo de Deus, em sonhos: Jacó! E eu disse: Eis-me {aqui.}\\nE disse ele: Levanta, agora, os teus olhos e vê que todos os bodes que cobrem o rebanho {são} listrados, salpicados e malhados; porque tenho visto tudo o que Labão te fez.\\nEu {sou} o Deus de Betel, onde tens ungido uma coluna, onde me tens feito o voto; levanta-te agora, sai-te desta terra e torna-te à terra da tua parentela.\\nEntão, responderam Raquel e Léia e disseram-lhe: {Há} ainda para nós parte ou herança na casa de nosso pai?\\nNão nos considera ele como estranhas? Pois vendeu-nos e comeu todo o nosso dinheiro.\\nPorque toda a riqueza que Deus tirou de nosso pai é nossa e de nossos filhos; agora, pois, faze tudo o que Deus te tem dito.\\nEntão, se levantou Jacó, pondo os seus filhos e as suas mulheres sobre os camelos,\\ne levou todo o seu gado e toda a sua fazenda que havia adquirido, o gado que possuía, que alcançara em Padã-Arã, para ir a Isaque, seu pai, à terra de Canaã.\\nE, havendo Labão ido a tosquiar as suas ovelhas, furtou Raquel os ídolos {Heb. terafim (ver Jz  17-5;  1sm  19-13; os  3-4} que seu pai {tinha.}\\nE esquivou-se Jacó de Labão, o arameu, {ou siro} porque não lhe fez saber que fugia.\\nE fugiu ele com tudo o que tinha; e levantou-se, e passou o rio, e pôs o seu rosto para a montanha de Gileade.\\nE, no terceiro dia, foi anunciado a Labão que Jacó tinha fugido.\\nEntão, tomou consigo os seus irmãos e atrás dele seguiu o seu caminho por sete dias; e alcançou-o na montanha de Gileade.\\nVeio, porém, Deus a Labão, o arameu, em sonhos, de noite, e disse-lhe: Guarda-te, que não fales a Jacó nem bem nem mal.\\nAlcançou, pois, Labão a Jacó. E armara Jacó a sua tenda naquela montanha; armou também Labão com os seus irmãos {a sua} na montanha de Gileade.\\nEntão, disse Labão a Jacó: Que fizeste, que te esquivaste de mim e levaste as minhas filhas como cativas pela espada?\\nPor que fugiste ocultamente, e te esquivaste de mim, e não me fizeste saber, para que eu te enviasse com alegria, e com cânticos, e com tamboril, e com harpa?\\nTambém não me permitiste beijar os meus filhos e as minhas filhas. Loucamente, {pois,} agora andaste, fazendo {assim.}\\nPoder havia em minha mão para vos fazer mal, mas o Deus de vosso pai me falou ontem à noite, dizendo: Guarda-te, que não fales a Jacó nem bem nem mal.\\nE agora, se te querias ir {embora,} porquanto tinhas saudades de voltar à casa de teu pai, por que furtaste os meus deuses?\\nEntão, respondeu Jacó e disse a Labão: Porque temia; pois que dizia {comigo} se porventura me não arrebatarias as tuas filhas.\\nCom quem achares os teus deuses, esse não viva; reconhece diante de nossos irmãos o que {é} teu do que está comigo e toma-o para ti. Pois Jacó não sabia que Raquel os tinha furtado.\\nEntão, entrou Labão na tenda de Jacó, e na tenda de Léia, e na tenda de ambas as servas e não {os} achou; e, saindo da tenda de Léia, entrou na tenda de Raquel.\\nMas tinha tomado Raquel os ídolos, e os tinha posto na albarda de um camelo, e assentara-se sobre eles; e apalpou Labão toda a tenda e não {os} achou.\\nE ela disse a seu pai: Não se acenda a ira nos olhos de meu senhor, que não posso levantar-me diante da tua face; porquanto {tenho} o costume das mulheres. E ele procurou, mas não achou os ídolos.\\nEntão, irou-se Jacó e contendeu com Labão. E respondeu Jacó e disse a Labão: Qual {é} a minha transgressão? Qual {é} o meu pecado, que {tão} furiosamente me tens perseguido?\\nHavendo apalpado todos os meus móveis, que achaste de todos os móveis da tua casa? Põe-no aqui diante dos meus irmãos e teus irmãos; e {que} julguem entre nós ambos.\\nEstes vinte anos eu {estive} contigo, as tuas ovelhas e as tuas cabras nunca abortaram, e não comi os carneiros do teu rebanho.\\nNão te trouxe eu o despedaçado; eu o pagava; o furtado de dia e o furtado de noite da minha mão o requerias.\\nEstava eu {de sorte que} de dia me consumia o calor, e, de noite, a geada; e o meu sono foi-se dos meus olhos.\\nTenho estado agora vinte anos na tua casa; catorze te servi por tuas duas filhas e seis anos por teu rebanho; mas o meu salário tens mudado dez vezes.\\nSe o Deus de meu pai, o Deus de Abraão e o Temor de Isaque, não fora comigo, por certo me enviarias agora vazio. Deus atendeu à minha aflição e ao trabalho das minhas mãos e repreendeu-{te} ontem à noite.\\nEntão, respondeu Labão e disse a Jacó: {Estas} filhas {são} minhas filhas, e {estes} filhos {são} meus filhos, e {este} rebanho {é} o meu rebanho, e tudo o que vês meu {é;} e que farei, hoje, a estas minhas filhas ou aos filhos que tiveram?\\nAgora, pois, vem, e façamos concerto, eu e tu, que seja por testemunho entre mim e ti.\\nEntão, tomou Jacó uma pedra e erigiu-a {por} coluna.\\nE disse Jacó a seus irmãos: Ajuntai pedras. E tomaram pedras, e fizeram um montão, e comeram ali sobre aquele montão.\\nE chamou-lhe Labão Jegar-Saaduta; {que é, em Aramaico, o montão do testemunho} porém Jacó chamou-lhe Galeede. {que é, em Hebraico, o montão do testemunho}\\nEntão, disse Labão: Este montão {seja,} hoje, por testemunha entre mim e ti; por isso, se chamou o seu nome Galeede\\ne Mispa, {que significa torre de vigia} porquanto disse: Atente o SENHOR entre mim e ti, quando nós estivermos apartados um do outro.\\nSe afligires as minhas filhas e se tomares mulheres além das minhas filhas, {mesmo que} ninguém {esteja} conosco, atenta que Deus {é} testemunha entre mim e ti.\\nDisse mais Labão a Jacó: Eis aqui este mesmo montão, e eis aqui esta coluna que levantei entre mim e ti.\\nEste montão {seja} testemunha, e esta coluna {seja} testemunha de que eu não passarei este montão para lá e que tu não passarás este montão e esta coluna para cá, para mal.\\nO Deus de Abraão e o Deus de Naor, o Deus de seu pai, julguem entre nós. E jurou Jacó pelo Temor de Isaque, seu pai.\\nE sacrificou Jacó um sacrifício na montanha e convidou seus irmãos para comerem pão; e comeram pão e passaram a noite na montanha.\\nE levantou-se Labão pela manhã, de madrugada, e beijou seus filhos e suas filhas, e abençoou-os; e partiu e voltou Labão ao seu lugar.\\nE foi {também} Jacó o seu caminho, e encontraram-no os anjos de Deus.\\nE Jacó disse, quando os viu: Este {é} o exército de Deus. E chamou o nome daquele lugar Maanaim.\\nE enviou Jacó mensageiros diante da sua face a Esaú, seu irmão, à terra de Seir, território de Edom.\\nE ordenou-lhes, dizendo: Assim direis a meu senhor Esaú: Assim diz Jacó, teu servo: Como peregrino morei com Labão e me detive {lá} até agora.\\nE tenho bois, e jumentos, e ovelhas, e servos, e servas; e enviei para o anunciar a meu senhor, para que ache graça a teus olhos.\\nE os mensageiros tornaram a Jacó, dizendo: Fomos a teu irmão Esaú; e também ele vem a encontrar-te, e quatrocentos varões com ele.\\nEntão, Jacó temeu muito e angustiou-se; e repartiu em dois bandos o povo que com ele estava, e as ovelhas, e as vacas, e os camelos.\\nPorque dizia: Se Esaú vier a um bando e o ferir, o outro bando escapará.\\nDisse mais Jacó: Deus de meu pai Abraão e Deus de meu pai Isaque, ó SENHOR, que me disseste: Torna à tua terra e à tua parentela, e far-te-ei bem;\\nmenor sou eu que todas as beneficências e que toda a fidelidade que tiveste com teu servo; porque com meu cajado passei este Jordão e, agora, me tornei em dois bandos.\\nLivra-me, peço-te, da mão de meu irmão, da mão de Esaú, porque o temo, para que porventura não venha e me fira {e} a mãe com os filhos.\\nE tu o disseste: Certamente te farei bem e farei a tua semente como a areia do mar, que, pela multidão, não se pode contar.\\nE passou ali aquela noite; e tomou, do que lhe veio à sua mão, um presente para seu irmão Esaú:\\nduzentas cabras e vinte bodes; duzentas ovelhas e vinte carneiros;\\ntrinta camelas de leite com suas crias, quarenta vacas e dez novilhos; vinte jumentas e dez jumentinhos.\\nE deu-o na mão dos seus servos, cada rebanho à parte, e disse a seus servos: Passai adiante da minha face e ponde espaço entre rebanho e rebanho.\\nE ordenou ao primeiro, dizendo: Quando Esaú, meu irmão, te encontrar e te perguntar, dizendo: De quem {és,} para onde vais, de quem {são} estes diante da tua face?\\nEntão, dirás: São de teu servo Jacó, presente que envia a meu senhor, a Esaú; e eis que ele mesmo vem também atrás de nós.\\nE ordenou também ao segundo, e ao terceiro, e a todos os que vinham atrás dos rebanhos, dizendo: Conforme esta mesma palavra, falareis a Esaú, quando o achardes.\\nE direis também: Eis que o teu servo Jacó {vem} atrás de nós. Porque dizia: {Eu} o aplacarei com o presente que vai diante de mim e, depois, verei a sua face; porventura aceitará a minha face.\\nAssim, passou o presente diante da sua face; ele, porém, passou aquela noite no arraial.\\nE levantou-se aquela mesma noite, e tomou as suas duas mulheres, e as suas duas servas, e os seus onze filhos, e passou o vau de Jaboque.\\nE tomou-os e fê-los passar o ribeiro; e fez passar {tudo} o que tinha.\\nJacó, porém, ficou só; e lutou com ele um varão, até que a alva subia.\\nE, vendo que não prevalecia contra ele, tocou a juntura de sua coxa; e se deslocou a juntura da coxa de Jacó, lutando com ele.\\nE disse: Deixa-me ir, porque já a alva subiu. Porém ele disse: Não te deixarei ir, se me não abençoares.\\nE disse-lhe: Qual {é} o teu nome? E ele disse: Jacó.\\nEntão, disse: Não se chamará mais o teu nome Jacó, mas Israel, {que significa aquele que luta com Deus} pois, como príncipe, lutaste com Deus e com os homens e prevaleceste.\\nE Jacó lhe perguntou e disse: Dá-me, peço-te, a saber o teu nome. E disse: Por que perguntas pelo meu nome? E abençoou-o ali.\\nE chamou Jacó o nome daquele lugar Peniel, {que significa a face de Deus} porque {dizia:} Tenho visto a Deus face a face, e a minha alma foi salva.\\nE saiu-lhe o sol, quando passou a Peniel; e manquejava da sua coxa.\\nPor isso, os filhos de Israel não comem o nervo encolhido, que {está} sobre a juntura da coxa, até o dia de hoje, porquanto ele tocara a juntura da coxa de Jacó no nervo encolhido.\\nE levantou Jacó os olhos e olhou, e eis que vinha Esaú, e quatrocentos homens com ele. Então, repartiu os filhos entre Léia, e Raquel, e as duas servas.\\nE pôs as servas e seus filhos na frente e a Léia e a seus filhos, atrás; porém a Raquel e José, os derradeiros.\\nE ele mesmo passou adiante deles e inclinou-se à terra sete vezes, {até} que chegou a seu irmão.\\nEntão, Esaú correu-lhe ao encontro e abraçou-o; e lançou-se sobre o seu pescoço e beijou-o; e choraram.\\nDepois, levantou os seus olhos, e viu as mulheres e os meninos, e disse: Quem {são} estes contigo? E ele disse: Os filhos que Deus graciosamente tem dado a teu servo.\\nEntão, chegaram as servas, elas e os seus filhos, e inclinaram-se.\\nE chegou também Léia com seus filhos, e inclinaram-se; e, depois, chegaram José e Raquel e inclinaram-se.\\nE disse {Esaú:} De que te {serve} todo este bando que tenho encontrado? E ele disse: Para achar graça aos olhos de meu senhor.\\nMas Esaú disse: Eu tenho bastante, meu irmão; seja para ti o que tens.\\nEntão, disse Jacó: Não! Se, agora, tenho achado graça a teus olhos, peço-te que tomes o meu presente da minha mão, porquanto tenho visto o teu rosto, como se tivesse visto o rosto de Deus; e tomaste contentamento em mim.\\nToma, peço-te, a minha bênção, que te foi trazida; porque Deus graciosamente ma tem dado, e porque tenho de tudo. E instou com ele, até que a tomou.\\nE disse: Caminhemos, e andemos; e eu partirei adiante de ti.\\nPorém ele lhe disse: Meu senhor sabe que estes filhos {são} tenros e que tenho comigo ovelhas e vacas de leite; se as afadigarem somente um dia, todo o rebanho morrerá.\\nOra, passe o meu senhor diante da face de seu servo; e eu irei como guia pouco a pouco, conforme o passo do gado que está diante da minha face e conforme o passo dos meninos, até que chegue a meu senhor, em Seir.\\nE Esaú disse: Deixarei logo contigo desta gente que {está} comigo. E ele disse: Para que é isso? {Basta} que eu ache graça aos olhos de meu senhor.\\nAssim, tornou Esaú aquele dia pelo seu caminho a Seir.\\nJacó, porém, partiu para Sucote, e edificou para si uma {ou cabanas} casa, e fez cabanas para o seu gado; por isso, chamou o nome daquele lugar Sucote.\\nE chegou Jacó salvo à cidade de Siquém, que {está} na terra de Canaã, quando vinha de Padã-Arã; e fez o seu assento diante da cidade.\\nE comprou uma parte do campo, em que estendera a sua tenda, da mão dos filhos de Hamor, pai de Siquém, por cem peças de dinheiro.\\nE levantou ali um altar e chamou-lhe Deus, o Deus de Israel.\\nE saiu Diná, filha de Léia, que esta dera a Jacó, a ver as filhas da terra.\\nE Siquém, filho de Hamor, heveu, príncipe daquela terra, viu-a, e tomou-a, e deitou-se com ela, e humilhou-a.\\nE apegou-se a sua alma com Diná, filha de Jacó, e amou a moça, e falou {Heb. falou ao coração da moça} afetuosamente à moça.\\nFalou também Siquém a Hamor, seu pai, dizendo: Toma-me esta por mulher.\\nQuando Jacó ouviu que fora contaminada Diná, sua filha, estavam os seus filhos no campo com o gado; e calou-se Jacó até que viessem.\\nE saiu Hamor, pai de Siquém, a Jacó, para falar com ele.\\nE vieram os filhos de Jacó do campo; e, ouvindo isso, entristeceram-se os varões e iraram-se muito, pois aquele fizera doidice em Israel, deitando-se com a filha de Jacó, o que não se devia fazer assim.\\nEntão, falou Hamor com eles, dizendo: A alma de Siquém, meu filho, está namorada da vossa filha; dai-lha, peço-vos, por mulher.\\nAparentai-vos conosco, dai-nos as vossas filhas e tomai as nossas filhas para vós;\\ne habitareis conosco; e a terra estará diante da vossa face; habitai, e negociai nela, e tomai possessão nela.\\nE disse Siquém ao pai dela e aos irmãos dela: Ache eu graça a vossos olhos e darei o que me disserdes.\\nAumentai muito sobre mim o dote e a dádiva, e darei o que me disserdes; dai-me somente a moça por mulher.\\nEntão, responderam os filhos de Jacó a Siquém e a Hamor, seu pai, enganosamente, e falaram, porquanto havia contaminado a Diná, sua irmã.\\nE disseram-lhes: Não podemos fazer isso, que déssemos a nossa irmã a um varão não-circuncidado; porque isso {seria} uma vergonha para nós.\\nNisso, porém, consentiremos a vós: se fordes como nós, que se circuncide todo macho entre vós;\\nentão, dar-vos-emos as nossas filhas, e tomaremos nós as vossas filhas, e habitaremos convosco, e seremos um só povo.\\nMas, se não nos ouvirdes e não vos circuncidardes, tomaremos a nossa filha e ir-nos-emos.\\nE suas palavras foram boas aos olhos de Hamor e aos olhos de Siquém, filho de Hamor.\\nE não tardou o jovem em fazer isto; porque a filha de Jacó lhe agradava, e ele {era} o mais honrado de toda a casa de seu pai.\\nVieram, pois, Hamor e Siquém, seu filho, à porta da sua cidade e falaram aos varões da sua cidade, dizendo:\\nEstes varões {são} pacíficos conosco; portanto, habitarão nesta terra e negociarão nela; eis que a terra é larga de espaço diante da sua face; tomaremos nós as suas filhas por mulheres e lhes daremos as nossas filhas.\\nMas somente consentirão aqueles varões habitar conosco, para que sejamos um só povo, se todo macho entre nós se circuncidar, como eles {são} circuncidados.\\nO seu gado, e as suas possessões, e todos os seus animais não serão nossos? Consintamos somente com eles, e habitarão conosco.\\nE deram ouvidos a Hamor e a Siquém, seu filho, todos os que saíam da porta da cidade; e foi circuncidado todo macho, de todos os que saíam pela porta da sua cidade.\\nE aconteceu que, ao terceiro dia, quando estavam com a {mais violenta} dor, dois filhos de Jacó, Simeão e Levi, irmãos de Diná, tomaram cada um a sua espada, e entraram afoitamente na cidade, e mataram todo macho.\\nMataram também a fio de espada a Hamor, e a seu filho Siquém; e tomaram Diná da casa de Siquém e saíram.\\nVieram os filhos de Jacó aos mortos e saquearam a cidade, porquanto haviam contaminado a sua irmã.\\nAs suas ovelhas, e as suas vacas, e os seus jumentos, e o que na cidade e o que no campo {havia} tomaram;\\ne toda a sua fazenda, e todos os seus meninos, e as suas mulheres levaram presos e despojaram-nos de tudo o que {havia} em casa.\\nEntão, disse Jacó a Simeão e a Levi: Tendes-me turbado, fazendo-me cheirar mal entre os moradores desta terra, entre os cananeus e ferezeus; {sendo} eu pouco povo em número, ajuntar-se-ão, e ficarei destruído, eu e minha casa.\\nE eles disseram: Faria, pois, ele a nossa irmã, como a uma prostituta?\\nDepois, disse Deus a Jacó: Levanta-te, sobe a Betel e habita ali; faze ali um altar ao Deus que te apareceu quando fugiste diante da face de Esaú, teu irmão.\\nEntão, disse Jacó à sua família e a todos os que com ele {estavam:} Tirai os deuses estranhos que há no meio de vós, e purificai-vos, e mudai as vossas vestes.\\nE levantemo-nos e subamos a Betel; e ali farei um altar ao Deus que me respondeu no dia da minha angústia e {que} foi comigo no caminho que tenho andado.\\nEntão, deram a Jacó todos os deuses estranhos que {tinham} em suas mãos e as arrecadas que {estavam} em suas orelhas; e Jacó os escondeu debaixo do carvalho que {está} junto a Siquém.\\nE partiram; e o terror de Deus foi sobre as cidades que {estavam} ao redor deles, e não seguiram após os filhos de Jacó.\\nAssim, chegou Jacó a Luz, que {está} na terra de Canaã (esta {é} Betel), ele e todo o povo que com ele {havia.}\\nE edificou ali um altar e chamou aquele lugar El-Betel, {que significa o Deus de Betel} porquanto Deus ali se lhe tinha manifestado quando fugia diante da face de seu irmão.\\nE morreu Débora, a ama de Rebeca, e foi sepultada ao pé de Betel, debaixo do carvalho cujo nome chamou Alom-Bacute. {que significa o carvalho de pranto}\\nE apareceu Deus outra vez a Jacó, vindo de Padã-Arã, e abençoou-o.\\nE disse-lhe Deus: O teu nome {é} Jacó; não se chamará mais o teu nome Jacó, mas Israel será o teu nome. E chamou o seu nome Israel.\\nDisse-lhe mais Deus: Eu {sou} o Deus Todo-poderoso; frutifica e multiplica-te; uma nação e multidão de nações sairão de ti, e reis procederão de ti.\\nE te darei a ti a terra que tenho dado a Abraão e a Isaque e à tua semente depois de ti darei a terra.\\nE Deus subiu dele, do lugar onde falara com ele.\\nE Jacó pôs uma coluna no lugar onde falara com ele, uma coluna de pedra; e derramou sobre ela uma libação e deitou sobre ela azeite.\\nE chamou Jacó o nome daquele lugar, onde Deus falara com ele, Betel.\\nPartiram de Betel, e, havendo ainda um pequeno espaço de terra para chegar a Efrata, teve um filho Raquel e teve trabalho em seu parto.\\nE aconteceu que, tendo ela trabalho em seu parto, lhe disse a parteira: Não temas, porque também este filho terás.\\nE aconteceu que, saindo-se-lhe a alma (porque morreu), chamou o seu nome Benoni; {que significa filho de minha dor} mas seu pai o chamou Benjamim. {que significa filho da destra}\\nAssim, morreu Raquel e foi sepultada no caminho de Efrata; esta {é} Belém.\\nE Jacó pôs uma coluna sobre a sua sepultura; esta {é} a coluna da sepultura de Raquel até o dia de hoje.\\nEntão, partiu Israel e estendeu a sua tenda além de Migdal-Éder. {ou a torre de Éder}\\nE aconteceu que, habitando Israel naquela terra, foi Rúben e deitou-se com Bila, concubina de seu pai; e Israel soube-o. E eram doze os filhos de Jacó:\\nos filhos de Léia: Rúben, o primogênito de Jacó, depois Simeão e Levi, Judá, Issacar e Zebulom;\\nos filhos de Raquel: José e Benjamim;\\nos filhos de Bila, serva de Raquel: Dã e Naftali;\\nos filhos de Zilpa, serva de Léia: Gade e Aser. Estes {são} os filhos de Jacó, que lhe nasceram em Padã-Arã.\\nE Jacó veio a Isaque, seu pai, a Manre, a Quiriate-Arba (que {é} Hebrom), onde peregrinaram Abraão e Isaque.\\nE foram os dias de Isaque cento e oitenta anos.\\nE Isaque expirou, e morreu, e foi recolhido aos seus povos, velho e farto de dias; e Esaú e Jacó, seus filhos, o sepultaram.\\nE estas {são} as gerações de Esaú (que {é} Edom).\\nEsaú tomou suas mulheres das filhas de Canaã: Ada, filha de Elom, heteu; Oolibama, filha de Aná, filho de Zibeão, heveu;\\ne Basemate, filha de Ismael, irmã de Nebaiote.\\nE Ada teve de Esaú a Elifaz; e Basemate teve a Reuel;\\ne Oolibama teve a Jeús, e Jalão, e Corá; estes {são} os filhos de Esaú, que lhe nasceram na terra de Canaã.\\nE Esaú tomou suas mulheres, e seus filhos, e suas filhas, e todas as almas de sua casa, e seu gado, e todos os seus animais, e toda a sua fazenda, que havia adquirido na terra de Canaã; e foi-se a {outra} terra de diante da face de Jacó, seu irmão.\\nPorque a fazenda deles era muita para habitarem juntos; e a terra de suas peregrinações não os podia sustentar por causa de seu gado.\\nPortanto, Esaú habitou na montanha de Seir; Esaú é Edom.\\nEstas, pois, {são} as gerações de Esaú, pai dos edomitas, na montanha de Seir.\\nEstes {são} os nomes dos filhos de Esaú: Elifaz, filho de Ada, mulher de Esaú; Reuel, filho de Basemate, mulher de Esaú.\\nE os filhos de Elifaz foram: Temã, Omar, Zefô, Gaetã e Quenaz.\\nE Timna era concubina de Elifaz, filho de Esaú, e teve de Elifaz a Amaleque; estes {são} os filhos de Ada, mulher de Esaú.\\nE estes {foram} os filhos de Reuel: Naate, Zerá, Samá e Mizá; estes foram os filhos de Basemate, mulher de Esaú.\\nE estes foram os filhos de Oolibama, filha de Aná, filho de Zibeão, mulher de Esaú; e deu a Esaú: Jeús, Jalão e Corá.\\nEstes {são} os príncipes dos filhos de Esaú; os filhos de Elifaz, o primogênito de Esaú, {foram:} o príncipe Temã, o príncipe Omar, o príncipe Zefô, o príncipe Quenaz,\\no príncipe Corá, o príncipe Gaetã, o príncipe Amaleque; estes são os príncipes de Elifaz, na terra de Edom; estes {são} os filhos de Ada.\\nE estes {são} os filhos de Reuel, filho de Esaú: o príncipe Naate, o príncipe Zerá, o príncipe Samá, o príncipe Mizá; estes são os príncipes de Reuel, na terra de Edom; estes {são} os filhos de Basemate, mulher de Esaú.\\nE estes {são} os filhos de Oolibama, mulher de Esaú: o príncipe Jeús, o príncipe Jalão, o príncipe Corá; estes {são} os príncipes de Oolibama, filha de Aná e mulher de Esaú.\\nEstes {são} os filhos de Esaú, e estes {são} seus príncipes; ele {é} Edom.\\nEstes {são} os filhos de Seir, horeu, moradores daquela terra: Lotã, Sobal, Zibeão, Aná,\\nDisom, Eser e Disã; estes {são} os príncipes dos horeus, filhos de Seir, na terra de Edom.\\nE os filhos de Lotã foram: Hori e Homã; e a irmã de Lotã {era} Timna.\\nEstes {são} os filhos de Sobal: Alvã, Manaate, Ebal, Sefô e Onã.\\nE estes {são} os filhos de Zibeão: Aiá e Aná; este {é} o Aná que achou as caldas no deserto, quando apascentava os jumentos de Zibeão, seu pai.\\nE estes {são} os filhos de Aná: Disom e Oolibama, a filha de Aná.\\nE estes {são} os filhos de Disom: Hendã, Esbã, Itrã e Querã.\\nEstes {são} os filhos de Eser: Bilã, Zaavã e Acã.\\nEstes {são} os filhos de Disã: Uz e Arã.\\nEstes {são} os príncipes dos horeus: o príncipe Lotã, o príncipe Sobal, o príncipe Zibeão, o príncipe Aná,\\no príncipe Disom, o príncipe Eser, o príncipe Disã; estes {são} os príncipes dos horeus, segundo seus príncipes, na terra de Seir.\\nE estes {são} os reis que reinaram na terra de Edom, antes que reinasse rei {algum} sobre os filhos de Israel.\\nReinou, pois, em Edom Belá, filho de Beor, e o nome da sua cidade {foi} Dinabá.\\nE morreu Belá; e Jobabe, filho de Zerá, de Bozra, reinou em seu lugar.\\nE morreu Jobabe; e Husão, da terra dos temanitas, reinou em seu lugar.\\nE morreu Husão, e em seu lugar reinou Hadade, filho de Bedade, o que feriu a Midiã no campo de Moabe; e o nome da sua cidade {foi} Avite.\\nE morreu Hadade; e Samlá, de Masreca, reinou em seu lugar.\\nE morreu Samlá; e Saul, de Reobote do rio, reinou em seu lugar.\\nE morreu Saul; e Baal-Hanã, filho de Acbor, reinou em seu lugar.\\nE morreu Baal-Hanã, filho de Acbor; e Hadar reinou em seu lugar; o nome da sua cidade {foi} Paú; e o nome de sua mulher {foi} Meetabel, filha de Matrede, filha de Me-Zaabe.\\nE estes {são} os nomes dos príncipes de Esaú, segundo as suas gerações, segundo os seus lugares, pelos seus nomes: o príncipe Timna, o príncipe Alva, o príncipe Jetete,\\no príncipe Oolibama, o príncipe Elá, o príncipe Pinom,\\no príncipe Quenaz, o príncipe Temã, o príncipe Mibzar,\\no príncipe Magdiel, o príncipe Irã; estes {são} os príncipes de Edom, segundo as suas habitações, na terra da sua possessão; este {é} Esaú, pai de Edom.\\nE Jacó habitou na terra das peregrinações de seu pai, na terra de Canaã.\\nEstas {são} as gerações de Jacó: {Sendo} José de dezessete anos, apascentava as ovelhas com seus irmãos; e {estava} este jovem com os filhos de Bila e com os filhos de Zilpa, mulheres de seu pai; e José trazia uma má fama deles a seu pai.\\nE Israel amava a José mais do que a todos os seus filhos, porque {era} filho da sua velhice; e fez-lhe uma túnica de {várias} cores.\\nVendo, pois, seus irmãos que seu pai o amava mais do que a todos os seus irmãos, aborreceram-no e não podiam falar com ele pacificamente.\\nSonhou também José um sonho, que contou a seus irmãos; por isso, o aborreciam ainda mais.\\nE disse-lhes: Ouvi, peço-vos, este sonho, que tenho sonhado:\\nEis que {estávamos} atando molhos no meio do campo, e eis que o meu molho se levantava e também ficava em pé; e eis que os vossos molhos o rodeavam e se inclinavam ao meu molho.\\nEntão, lhe disseram seus irmãos: Tu, pois, deveras reinarás sobre nós? Tu deveras terás domínio sobre nós? Por isso, tanto mais o aborreciam por seus sonhos e por suas palavras.\\nE sonhou ainda outro sonho, e o contou a seus irmãos, e disse: Eis que ainda sonhei um sonho; e eis que o sol, e a lua, e onze estrelas se inclinavam a mim.\\nE, contando-o a seu pai e a seus irmãos, repreendeu-o seu pai e disse-lhe: Que sonho {é} este que sonhaste? Porventura viremos eu, e tua mãe, e teus irmãos a inclinar-nos perante ti em terra?\\nSeus irmãos, pois, o invejavam; seu pai, porém, guardava este negócio {no seu coração.}\\nE seus irmãos foram apascentar o rebanho de seu pai, junto de Siquém.\\nDisse, pois, Israel a José: Não apascentam os teus irmãos junto de Siquém? Vem, e enviar-te-ei a eles. E ele lhe disse: Eis-me {aqui.}\\nE ele lhe disse: Ora, vai, e vê como estão teus irmãos e como está o rebanho, e traze-me resposta. Assim, o enviou do vale de Hebrom, e José veio a Siquém.\\nE achou-o um varão, porque ele andava errado pelo campo, e perguntou-lhe o varão, dizendo: Que procuras?\\nE ele disse: Procuro meus irmãos; dize-me, peço-te, onde eles apascentam.\\nE disse aquele varão: Foram-se daqui, porque ouvi-lhes dizer: Vamos a Dotã. José, pois, seguiu seus irmãos e achou-os em Dotã.\\nE viram-no de longe e, antes que chegasse a eles, conspiraram contra ele, para o matarem.\\nE disseram uns aos outros: Eis lá vem o sonhador-mor!\\nVinde, pois, agora, e matemo-lo, e lancemo-lo numa destas covas, e diremos: Uma besta-fera o comeu; e veremos que será dos seus sonhos.\\nE, ouvindo-o Rúben, livrou-o das suas mãos e disse: Não lhe tiremos a vida.\\nTambém lhes disse Rúben: Não derrameis sangue; lançai-o nesta cova que {está} no deserto e não lanceis mãos nele; para livrá-lo das suas mãos e para torná-lo a seu pai.\\nE aconteceu que, chegando José a seus irmãos, tiraram a José a sua túnica, a túnica de {várias} cores que trazia.\\nE tomaram-no e lançaram-no na cova; porém a cova {estava} vazia, não {havia} água nela.\\nDepois, assentaram-se a comer pão, e levantaram os olhos, e olharam, e eis que uma companhia de ismaelitas vinha de Gileade; e seus camelos traziam especiarias, e bálsamo, e mirra; e iam levar isso ao Egito.\\nEntão, Judá disse aos seus irmãos: Que proveito {haverá} em que matemos a nosso irmão e escondamos a {Heb. o seu sangue} sua morte?\\nVinde, e vendamo-lo a estes ismaelitas; e não seja nossa mão sobre ele, porque ele é nosso irmão, nossa carne. E seus irmãos obedeceram.\\nPassando, pois, os mercadores midianitas, tiraram, e alçaram a José da cova, e venderam José por vinte {moedas} de prata aos ismaelitas, os quais levaram José ao Egito.\\nTornando, pois, Rúben à cova, eis que José não {estava} na cova; então, rasgou as suas vestes,\\ne tornou a seus irmãos, e disse: O moço não {aparece;} e, eu, aonde irei?\\nEntão, tomaram a túnica de José, e mataram um cabrito, e tingiram a túnica no sangue.\\nE enviaram a túnica de {várias} cores, e fizeram levá-la a seu pai, e disseram: Temos achado esta {túnica;} conhece agora se esta {será} ou não a túnica de teu filho.\\nE conheceu-a e disse: É a túnica de meu filho; uma besta-fera o comeu, certamente foi despedaçado José.\\nEntão, Jacó rasgou as suas vestes, e pôs pano de saco sobre os seus lombos, e lamentou a seu filho muitos dias.\\nE levantaram-se todos os seus filhos e todas as suas filhas, para o consolarem; recusou, porém, ser consolado e disse: Na verdade, com choro hei de descer ao meu filho até à sepultura. Assim, o chorou seu pai.\\nE os midianitas venderam-no no Egito a Potifar, eunuco {ou oficial} de Faraó, capitão da guarda.\\nE aconteceu, no mesmo tempo, que Judá desceu de entre seus irmãos e entrou {na casa de} um varão de Adulão, cujo nome {era} Hira.\\nE viu Judá ali a filha de um varão cananeu, cujo nome {era} Sua; e tomou-a e entrou a ela.\\nE ela concebeu e teve um filho; e chamou o seu nome Er.\\nE tornou a conceber, e teve um filho, e chamou o seu nome Onã.\\nE continuou ainda, e teve um filho, e chamou o seu nome Selá; e ele estava em Quezibe quando ela o teve.\\nJudá, pois, tomou uma mulher para Er, o seu primogênito; e o seu nome {era} Tamar.\\nEr, porém, o primogênito de Judá, era mau aos olhos do SENHOR, pelo que o SENHOR o matou.\\nEntão, disse Judá a Onã: Entra à mulher do teu irmão, e casa-te com ela, e suscita semente a teu irmão.\\nOnã, porém, soube que essa semente não havia de ser para ele; e aconteceu que, quando entrava à mulher de seu irmão, derramava-{a} na terra, para não dar semente a seu irmão.\\nE o que fazia era mau aos olhos do SENHOR, pelo que também o matou.\\nEntão, disse Judá a Tamar, sua nora: Fica-te viúva na casa de teu pai, até que Selá, meu filho, seja grande. Porquanto disse: Para que, porventura, não morra também este, como seus irmãos. Assim, foi-se Tamar e ficou-se na casa de seu pai.\\nPassando-se, pois, muitos dias, morreu a filha de Sua, mulher de Judá; e, depois, se consolou Judá e subiu aos tosquiadores das suas ovelhas, em Timna, ele e Hira, seu amigo, o adulamita.\\nE deram aviso a Tamar, dizendo: Eis que teu sogro sobe a Timna, a tosquiar as suas ovelhas.\\nEntão, ela tirou de sobre si as vestes da sua viuvez, e cobriu-se com o véu, e disfarçou-se, e assentou-se à {ou na porta de Enaim} entrada das duas fontes que {estão} no caminho de Timna; porque via que Selá já era grande, e ela lhe não fora dada por mulher.\\nE, vendo-a Judá, teve-a por uma prostituta; porque ela havia coberto o seu rosto.\\nE dirigiu-se para ela no caminho e disse: Vem, peço-te, deixa-me entrar a ti. Porquanto não sabia que {era} sua nora; e ela disse: Que darás, para que entres a mim?\\nE ele disse: Eu {te} enviarei um cabrito do rebanho. E ela disse: Dás-me penhor até que o envies?\\nEntão, ele disse: Que penhor é que te darei? E ela disse: O teu selo, e o teu lenço, {ou cordão} e o cajado que {está} em tua mão. O que ele lhe deu, e entrou a ela; e ela concebeu dele.\\nE ela levantou-se, e foi-se, e tirou de sobre si o seu véu, e vestiu as vestes da sua viuvez.\\nE Judá enviou o cabrito por mão do seu amigo, o adulamita, para tomar o penhor da mão da mulher; porém não a achou.\\nE perguntou aos homens daquele lugar, dizendo: Onde {está} a prostituta que {estava} no caminho junto às duas fontes? E disseram: Aqui não esteve prostituta {alguma.}\\nE voltou a Judá e disse: Não a achei; e também disseram os homens daquele lugar: Aqui não esteve prostituta.\\nEntão, disse Judá: Tome-{o} ela, para que porventura não venhamos {a cair} em desprezo; eis que tenho enviado este cabrito, mas tu não a achaste.\\nE aconteceu que, quase três meses depois, deram aviso a Judá, dizendo: Tamar, tua nora, adulterou e eis que {está} pejada do adultério. Então, disse Judá: Tirai-a fora para que seja queimada.\\nE, tirando-a fora, ela mandou dizer a seu sogro: Do varão de quem {são estas} coisas eu concebi. E ela disse mais: Conhece, peço-te, de quem {é} este selo, e estes lenços, {ou cordões} e este cajado.\\nE conheceu-os Judá e disse: Mais justa é {ela} do que eu, porquanto não a tenho dado a Selá, meu filho. E nunca mais a conheceu.\\nE aconteceu, ao tempo de dar à luz, que {havia} gêmeos em seu ventre.\\nE aconteceu, dando à luz, que {um} pôs fora a mão, e a parteira tomou-a e atou em sua mão um {fio} roxo, dizendo: Este saiu primeiro.\\nMas aconteceu que, tornando ele a recolher a sua mão, eis que saiu o seu irmão; e ela disse: Como tens tu rompido? Sobre ti é a rotura. E chamaram o seu nome Perez.\\nE depois saiu o seu irmão, em cuja mão estava o {fio} roxo; e chamaram o seu nome Zerá.\\nE José foi levado ao Egito, e Potifar, eunuco {ou oficial} de Faraó, capitão da guarda, varão egípcio, comprou-o da mão dos ismaelitas que o tinham levado lá.\\nE o SENHOR estava com José, e foi varão próspero; e estava na casa de seu senhor egípcio.\\nVendo, pois, o seu senhor que o SENHOR {estava} com ele e que tudo o que ele fazia o SENHOR prosperava em sua mão,\\nJosé achou graça a seus olhos e servia-o; e ele o pôs sobre a sua casa e entregou na sua mão tudo o que tinha.\\nE aconteceu que, desde que o pusera sobre a sua casa e sobre tudo o que tinha, o SENHOR abençoou a casa do egípcio por amor de José; e a bênção do SENHOR foi sobre tudo o que tinha, na casa e no campo.\\nE deixou tudo o que tinha na mão de José, de maneira que de nada sabia {do que estava} com ele, a não ser do pão que comia. E José era formoso de aparência e formoso à vista.\\nE aconteceu, depois destas coisas, que a mulher de seu senhor pôs os olhos em José e disse: Deita-te comigo.\\nPorém ele recusou e disse à mulher do seu senhor: Eis que o meu senhor não sabe do que há em casa comigo e entregou em minha mão tudo o que tem.\\nNinguém {há} maior do que eu nesta casa, e nenhuma coisa me vedou, senão a ti, porquanto tu {és} sua mulher; como, pois, faria eu este tamanho mal e pecaria contra Deus?\\nE aconteceu que, falando ela cada dia a José, e não lhe dando ele ouvidos para deitar-se com ela {e} estar com ela,\\nsucedeu, num certo dia, que veio à casa para fazer o seu serviço; e nenhum dos da casa {estava} ali.\\nE ela lhe pegou pela sua veste, dizendo: Deita-te comigo. E ele deixou a sua veste na mão dela, e fugiu, e saiu para fora.\\nE aconteceu que, vendo ela que deixara a sua veste em sua mão e fugira para fora,\\nchamou os homens de sua casa e falou-lhes, dizendo: Vede, trouxe-nos o varão hebreu para escarnecer de nós; entrou até mim para deitar-se comigo, e eu gritei com grande voz.\\nE aconteceu que, ouvindo ele que eu levantava a minha voz e gritava, deixou a sua veste comigo, e fugiu, e saiu para fora.\\nE ela pôs a sua veste perto de si, até que o seu senhor veio à sua casa.\\nEntão, falou-lhe conforme as mesmas palavras, dizendo: Veio a mim o servo hebreu, que nos trouxeste para escarnecer de mim.\\nE aconteceu que, levantando eu a minha voz e gritando, ele deixou a sua veste comigo e fugiu para fora.\\nE aconteceu que, ouvindo o seu senhor as palavras de sua mulher, que lhe falava, dizendo: Conforme estas mesmas palavras me fez teu servo, a sua ira se acendeu.\\nE o senhor de José o tomou e o entregou na casa do cárcere, no lugar onde os presos do rei {estavam} presos; assim, esteve ali na casa do cárcere.\\nO SENHOR, porém, estava com José, e estendeu sobre ele a sua benignidade, e deu-lhe graça aos olhos do carcereiro-mor.\\nE o carcereiro-mor entregou na mão de José todos os presos que {estavam} na casa do cárcere; e ele fazia tudo o que se fazia ali.\\nE o carcereiro-mor não teve cuidado de nenhuma coisa {que estava} na mão dele, porquanto o SENHOR estava com ele; e {tudo} o que ele fazia o SENHOR prosperava.\\nE aconteceu, depois destas coisas, que pecaram o copeiro do rei do Egito e o padeiro contra o seu senhor, o rei do Egito.\\nE indignou-se Faraó muito contra os seus dois eunucos, contra o copeiro-mor e contra o padeiro-mor.\\nE entregou-os à prisão, na casa do capitão da guarda, na casa do cárcere, no lugar onde José {estava preso.}\\nE o capitão da guarda pô-los a cargo de José, para que os servisse; e estiveram {muitos} dias na prisão.\\nE ambos sonharam um sonho, cada um seu sonho na mesma noite; cada um conforme a interpretação do seu sonho, o copeiro e o padeiro do rei do Egito, que {estavam} presos na casa do cárcere.\\nE veio José a eles pela manhã e olhou para eles, e eis que {estavam} turbados.\\nEntão, perguntou aos eunucos de Faraó, que com ele {estavam} no cárcere da casa de seu senhor, dizendo: Por que {estão,} hoje, tristes os vossos semblantes?\\nE eles lhe disseram: Temos sonhado um sonho, e ninguém {há} que o interprete. E José disse-lhes: Não {são} de Deus as interpretações? Contai-mo, peço-vos.\\nEntão, contou o copeiro-mor o seu sonho a José e disse-lhe: Eis que em meu sonho {havia} uma vide diante da minha face.\\nE, na vide, três sarmentos, e ela estava como que brotando; a sua flor saía, e os seus cachos amadureciam em uvas.\\nE o copo de Faraó {estava} na minha mão; e eu tomava as uvas, e as espremia no copo de Faraó, e dava o copo na mão de Faraó.\\nEntão, disse-lhe José: Esta {é} a sua interpretação: os três sarmentos {são} três dias;\\ndentro ainda de três dias, Faraó levantará a tua cabeça e te restaurará ao teu estado, e darás o copo de Faraó na sua mão, conforme o costume antigo, quando eras seu copeiro.\\nPorém lembra-te de mim, quando te for bem; e rogo-te que uses comigo de compaixão, e que faças menção de mim a Faraó, e faze-me sair desta casa;\\nporque, de fato, fui roubado da terra dos hebreus; e tampouco aqui nada tenho feito, para que me pusessem nesta cova.\\nVendo, então, o padeiro-mor que tinha interpretado bem, disse a José: Eu também sonhava, e eis que três cestos {ou cestos de pão branco} brancos estavam sobre a minha cabeça;\\ne, no cesto mais alto, {havia} de todos os manjares de Faraó, obra de padeiro; e as aves os comiam do cesto de sobre a minha cabeça.\\nEntão, respondeu José e disse: Esta é {a} sua interpretação: os três cestos são três dias;\\ndentro ainda de três dias, Faraó levantará a tua cabeça sobre ti e te pendurará num madeiro, e as aves comerão a tua carne de sobre ti.\\nE aconteceu, ao terceiro dia, o dia do nascimento de Faraó, que fez um banquete a todos os seus servos; e levantou a cabeça do copeiro-mor e a cabeça do padeiro-mor, no meio dos seus servos.\\nE fez tornar o copeiro-mor ao seu ofício de copeiro, e este deu o copo na mão de Faraó.\\nMas ao padeiro-mor enforcou, como José havia interpretado.\\nO copeiro-mor, porém, não se lembrou de José; antes, se esqueceu dele.\\nE aconteceu que, ao fim de dois anos inteiros, Faraó sonhou e eis que estava em pé junto ao rio.\\nE eis que subiam do rio sete vacas, formosas à vista e gordas de carne, e pastavam no prado.\\nE eis que subiam do rio após elas outras sete vacas, feias à vista e magras de carne, e paravam junto às {outras} vacas na praia do rio.\\nE as vacas feias à vista e magras de carne comiam as sete vacas formosas à vista e gordas. Então, acordou Faraó.\\nDepois, dormiu e sonhou outra vez, e eis que brotavam de um mesmo pé sete espigas cheias e boas.\\nE eis que sete espigas miúdas e queimadas do vento oriental brotavam após elas.\\nE as espigas miúdas devoravam as sete espigas grandes e cheias. Então, acordou Faraó, e eis que {era um} sonho.\\nE aconteceu que, pela manhã, o seu espírito perturbou-se, e enviou e chamou todos os adivinhadores do Egito e todos os seus sábios; e Faraó contou-lhes os seus sonhos, mas ninguém {havia} que os interpretasse a Faraó.\\nEntão, falou o copeiro-mor a Faraó, dizendo: Dos meus pecados me lembro hoje.\\nEstando Faraó mui indignado contra os seus servos e pondo-me sob prisão na casa da guarda, a mim e ao padeiro-mor,\\nentão, sonhamos um sonho na mesma noite, eu e ele, cada um conforme a interpretação do seu sonho sonhamos.\\nE {estava} ali conosco um jovem hebreu, servo do capitão da guarda, e contamos-lhos, e interpretou-nos os nossos sonhos, a cada um interpretou conforme o seu sonho.\\nE como ele nos interpretou, assim {mesmo} foi feito: a mim me fez tornar ao meu estado, e a ele fez enforcar.\\nEntão, enviou Faraó e chamou a José, e o fizeram sair logo da cova; e barbeou-se, e mudou as suas vestes, e veio a Faraó.\\nE Faraó disse a José: Eu sonhei um sonho, e ninguém {há} que o interprete; mas de ti ouvi dizer {que, quando} ouves um sonho, o interpretas.\\nE respondeu José a Faraó, dizendo: Isso não está em mim; Deus dará resposta de paz a Faraó.\\nEntão, disse Faraó a José: Eis que em meu sonho estava eu em pé na praia do rio.\\nE eis que subiam do rio sete vacas gordas de carne e formosas à vista e pastavam no prado.\\nE eis que outras sete vacas subiam após estas, muito feias à vista e magras de carne; não tenho visto outras tais, quanto à fealdade, em toda a terra do Egito.\\nE as vacas magras e feias comiam as primeiras sete vacas gordas;\\ne entravam em suas entranhas, mas não se conhecia que houvessem entrado em suas entranhas, porque o seu aspecto {era} feio como no princípio. Então, acordei.\\nDepois, vi em meu sonho, e eis que de um mesmo pé subiam sete espigas cheias e boas.\\nE eis que sete espigas secas, miúdas {e} queimadas do vento oriental brotavam após elas.\\nE as sete espigas miúdas devoravam as sete espigas boas. E eu disse-o aos magos, mas ninguém {houve} que mo interpretasse.\\nEntão, disse José a Faraó: O sonho de Faraó {é} um só; o que Deus há de fazer, notificou-o a Faraó.\\nAs sete vacas formosas {são} sete anos; as sete espigas formosas também {são} sete anos; o sonho é um só.\\nE as sete vacas magras e feias à vista, que subiam depois delas, {são} sete anos, como as sete espigas miúdas e queimadas do vento oriental; serão sete anos de fome.\\nEsta {é} a palavra que tenho dito a Faraó; o que Deus há de fazer, mostrou-o a Faraó.\\nE eis que vêm sete anos, e haverá grande fartura em toda a terra do Egito.\\nE, depois deles, levantar-se-ão sete anos de fome, e toda aquela fartura será esquecida na terra do Egito, e a fome consumirá a terra;\\ne não será conhecida a abundância na terra, por causa daquela fome {que haverá} depois, porquanto será gravíssima.\\nE o sonho foi duplicado duas vezes a Faraó é porque esta coisa é determinada de Deus, e Deus se apressa a fazê-la.\\nPortanto, Faraó se proveja agora de um varão inteligente e sábio e o ponha sobre a terra do Egito.\\nFaça {isso} Faraó, e ponha governadores sobre a terra, e tome a quinta parte da terra do Egito nos sete anos de fartura.\\nE ajuntem toda a comida destes bons anos, que vêm, e amontoem trigo debaixo da mão de Faraó, para mantimento nas cidades, e o guardem.\\nAssim, será o mantimento para provimento da terra, para os sete anos de fome que haverá na terra do Egito; para que a terra não pereça de fome.\\nE esta palavra foi boa aos olhos de Faraó e aos olhos de todos os seus servos.\\nE disse Faraó a seus servos: Acharíamos um varão como este, em quem {haja} o Espírito de Deus?\\nDepois, disse Faraó a José: Pois que Deus te fez saber tudo isto, ninguém {há tão} inteligente e sábio como tu.\\nTu estarás sobre a minha casa, e por tua boca se governará todo o meu povo; somente no trono eu serei maior que tu.\\nDisse mais Faraó a José: Vês aqui te tenho posto sobre toda a terra do Egito.\\nE tirou Faraó o anel da sua mão, e o pôs na mão de José, e o fez vestir de vestes de linho fino, e pôs um colar de ouro no seu pescoço.\\nE o fez subir no segundo carro que tinha, e clamavam diante dele: Ajoelhai. Assim, o pôs sobre toda a terra do Egito.\\nE disse Faraó a José: Eu {sou} Faraó; porém sem ti ninguém levantará a sua mão ou o seu pé em toda a terra do Egito.\\nE chamou Faraó o nome de José Zafenate-Panéia {que significa salvador do mundo} e deu-lhe por mulher a Asenate, filha de Potífera, sacerdote de Om; e saiu José por {toda} a terra do Egito.\\nE José {era} da idade de trinta anos quando esteve diante da face de Faraó, rei do Egito. E saiu José da face de Faraó e passou por toda a terra do Egito.\\nE a terra produziu nos sete anos de fartura a mãos-cheias.\\nE ajuntou todo o mantimento dos sete anos que houve na terra do Egito; e guardou o mantimento nas cidades, pondo nas cidades o mantimento do campo que {estava} ao redor de cada cidade.\\nAssim, ajuntou José muitíssimo trigo, como a areia do mar, até que cessou de contar, porquanto não {havia} numeração.\\nE nasceram a José dois filhos (antes que viesse o ano de fome), que lhe deu Asenate, filha de Potífera, sacerdote de Om.\\nE chamou José o nome do primogênito Manassés, {que significa que faz esquecer} porque {disse:} Deus me fez esquecer de todo o meu trabalho e de toda a casa de meu pai.\\nE o nome do segundo chamou Efraim, {que significa duplamente frutífero} porque {disse:} Deus me fez crescer na terra da minha aflição.\\nEntão, acabaram-se os sete anos de fartura que havia na terra do Egito,\\ne começaram a vir os sete anos de fome, como José tinha dito; e havia fome em todas as terras, mas em toda a terra do Egito havia pão.\\nE, tendo toda a terra do Egito fome, clamou o povo a Faraó por pão; e Faraó disse a todos os egípcios: Ide a José; o que ele vos disser fazei.\\nHavendo, pois, fome sobre toda a terra, abriu José tudo em que havia {mantimento} e vendeu aos egípcios; porque a fome prevaleceu na terra do Egito.\\nE todas as terras vinham ao Egito, para comprar de José, porquanto a fome prevaleceu em todas as terras.\\nVendo, então, Jacó que havia mantimento no Egito, disse Jacó a seus filhos: Por que estais olhando uns para os outros?\\nDisse mais: Eis que tenho ouvido que há mantimento no Egito; descei até lá e comprai-nos trigo, para que vivamos e não morramos.\\nEntão, desceram os dez irmãos de José, para comprarem trigo no Egito.\\nA Benjamim, porém, irmão de José, não enviou Jacó com os seus irmãos, porque dizia: Para que lhe não suceda, porventura, algum desastre.\\nAssim, vieram os filhos de Israel para comprar, entre os que vinham {lá;} porque havia fome na terra de Canaã.\\nJosé, pois, era o governador daquela terra; ele vendia a todo o povo da terra; e os irmãos de José vieram e inclinaram-se ante ele com a face na terra.\\nE José, vendo os seus irmãos, conheceu-os; porém mostrou-se estranho para com eles, e falou com eles asperamente, e disse-lhes: Donde vindes? E eles disseram: Da terra de Canaã, para comprarmos mantimento.\\nJosé, pois, conheceu os seus irmãos; mas eles não o conheceram.\\nEntão, José lembrou-se dos sonhos que havia sonhado deles e disse-lhes: Vós sois espias {e} viestes para ver a nudez da terra.\\nE eles lhe disseram: Não, senhor meu; mas teus servos vieram a comprar mantimento.\\nTodos nós somos filhos de um varão; somos homens de retidão; os teus servos não são espias.\\nE ele lhes disse: Não; antes, viestes para ver a nudez da terra.\\nE eles disseram: Nós, teus servos, {somos} doze irmãos, filhos de um varão da terra de Canaã; e eis que o mais novo está com nosso pai, hoje; mas um já não existe.\\nEntão, lhes disse José: Isso {é} o que vos tenho dito, dizendo que {sois} espias.\\nNisto sereis provados: pela vida de Faraó, não saireis daqui senão quando vosso irmão mais novo vier aqui.\\nEnviai um dentre vós, que traga vosso irmão; mas vós ficareis presos, e vossas palavras serão provadas, se {há} verdade convosco; e, se não, pela vida de Faraó, vós sois espias.\\nE pô-los juntos em guarda três dias.\\nE, ao terceiro dia, disse-lhes José: Fazei isso e vivereis, {porque} eu temo a Deus.\\nSe sois homens de retidão, que fique um de vossos irmãos preso na casa de vossa prisão; e, vós, ide, levai trigo para a fome de vossa casa.\\nE trazei-me o vosso irmão mais novo, e serão verificadas vossas palavras, e não morrereis. E eles assim fizeram.\\nEntão, disseram uns aos outros: Na verdade, {somos} culpados acerca de nosso irmão, pois vimos a angústia de sua alma, quando nos rogava; nós, porém, não ouvimos; por isso, vem sobre nós esta angústia.\\nE Rúben respondeu-lhes, dizendo: Não vo-lo dizia eu, dizendo: Não pequeis contra o moço? Mas não ouvistes; e, vedes aqui, o seu sangue também é requerido.\\nE eles não sabiam que José os entendia, porque {havia} intérprete entre eles.\\nE retirou-se deles e chorou. Depois, tornou a eles, falou-lhes, tomou a Simeão dentre eles e amarrou-o perante os seus olhos.\\nE ordenou José que enchessem os seus sacos de trigo, e que {lhes} restituíssem o seu dinheiro, a cada um no seu saco, e lhes dessem comida para o caminho; e fizeram-lhes assim.\\nE carregaram o seu trigo sobre os seus jumentos e partiram dali.\\nE, abrindo um {deles} o seu saco, para dar pasto ao seu jumento na venda, viu o seu dinheiro; porque eis que estava na boca do seu saco.\\nE disse a seus irmãos: Devolveram o meu dinheiro, e ei-lo mesmo aqui no meu saco. Então, lhes desfaleceu o coração, e pasmavam, dizendo um ao outro: Que é isto que Deus nos tem feito?\\nE vieram para Jacó, seu pai, na terra de Canaã; e contaram-lhe tudo o que lhes aconteceu, dizendo:\\nO varão, o senhor da terra, falou conosco asperamente e tratou-nos como espias da terra.\\nMas dissemos-lhe: Somos {homens} de retidão; não somos espias;\\n{somos} doze irmãos, filhos de nosso pai; um não {é mais,} e o mais novo {está} hoje com nosso pai na terra de Canaã.\\nE aquele varão, o senhor da terra, nos disse: Nisto conhecerei que vós sois {homens} de retidão: deixai comigo um de vossos irmãos, e tomai para a fome de vossas casas, e parti;\\ne trazei-me vosso irmão mais novo; assim, saberei que não sois espias, mas {homens} de retidão; {então,} vos darei o vosso irmão, e negociareis na terra.\\nE aconteceu que, despejando eles os seus sacos, eis que cada um tinha a trouxinha com seu dinheiro no seu saco; e viram as trouxinhas com seu dinheiro, eles e seu pai, e temeram.\\nEntão, Jacó, seu pai, disse-lhes: Tendes-me desfilhado: José já não existe, e Simeão não {está} aqui, e, agora, levareis a Benjamim! Todas estas coisas vieram sobre mim.\\nMas Rúben falou a seu pai, dizendo: Mata os meus dois filhos, se to não tornar a trazer; dá-mo em minha mão, e to tornarei a trazer.\\nEle, porém, disse: Não descerá meu filho convosco, porquanto o seu irmão é morto, e só ele ficou. Se lhe sucede algum desastre no caminho por onde fordes, fareis descer minhas cãs com tristeza à sepultura.\\nE a fome {era} gravíssima na terra.\\nE aconteceu que, como acabaram de comer o mantimento que trouxeram do Egito, disse-lhes seu pai: Tornai, comprai-nos um pouco de alimento.\\nMas Judá respondeu-lhe, dizendo: Fortemente nos protestou aquele varão, dizendo: Não vereis a minha face, se o vosso irmão não {vier} convosco.\\nSe enviares conosco o nosso irmão, desceremos e te compraremos alimento;\\nmas, se não {o} enviares, não desceremos, porquanto aquele varão nos disse: Não vereis a minha face, se o vosso irmão não {vier} convosco.\\nE disse Israel: Por que me fizestes {tal} mal, fazendo saber àquele varão que tínheis ainda {outro} irmão?\\nE eles disseram: Aquele varão particularmente nos perguntou por nós e pela nossa parentela, dizendo: Vive ainda vosso pai? Tendes mais um irmão? E respondemos-lhe conforme as mesmas palavras. Podíamos nós saber que diria: Trazei vosso irmão?\\nEntão, disse Judá a Israel, seu pai: Envia o jovem comigo, e levantar-nos-emos e iremos, para que vivamos e não morramos, nem nós, nem tu, nem os nossos filhos.\\nEu serei fiador por ele, da minha mão o requererás; se eu não to trouxer e não o puser perante a tua face, serei réu de crime para contigo para sempre.\\nE, se nós não nos tivéssemos detido, certamente já estaríamos segunda vez de volta.\\nEntão, disse-lhes Israel, seu pai: Pois que assim {é,} fazei isso; tomai do mais precioso desta terra em vossos sacos e levai ao varão um presente: um pouco de bálsamo, um pouco de mel, especiarias, mirra, terebinto e amêndoas. {ou nozes da pistaceira}\\nE tomai em vossas mãos dinheiro dobrado; e o dinheiro que tornou na boca dos vossos sacos tornai a levar em vossas mãos; bem pode ser que fosse erro.\\nTomai também a vosso irmão, e levantai-vos, e voltai àquele varão.\\nE Deus Todo-poderoso vos dê misericórdia diante do varão, para que deixe vir convosco vosso outro irmão, e Benjamim; e eu, {se for} desfilhado, desfilhado ficarei.\\nE os varões tomaram aquele presente e tomaram dinheiro dobrado em suas mãos e a Benjamim; e levantaram-se, e desceram ao Egito, e apresentaram-se diante da face de José.\\nVendo, pois, José a Benjamim com eles, disse ao que {estava} sobre a sua casa: Leva {estes} varões à casa, e mata reses, e prepara tudo; porque {estes} varões comerão comigo ao meio-dia.\\nE o varão fez como José dissera e o varão levou aqueles varões à casa de José.\\nEntão, temeram aqueles varões, porquanto foram levados à casa de José e diziam: Por causa do dinheiro que da outra vez voltou nos nossos sacos, fomos trazidos {aqui,} para nos criminar e cair sobre nós, para que nos tome por servos e a nossos jumentos.\\nPor isso, chegaram-se ao varão que {estava} sobre a casa de José, e falaram com ele à porta da casa.\\nE disseram: Ai! Senhor meu, certamente descemos, dantes, a comprar mantimento;\\ne aconteceu que, chegando nós à venda e abrindo os nossos sacos, eis que o dinheiro de cada varão {estava} na boca do seu saco, nosso dinheiro por seu peso; e tornamos a trazê-lo em nossas mãos.\\nTambém trouxemos outro dinheiro em nossas mãos, para comprar mantimento; não sabemos quem tenha posto o nosso dinheiro nos nossos sacos.\\nE ele disse: Paz {seja} convosco, não temais; o vosso Deus, e o Deus de vosso pai, vos tem dado um tesouro nos vossos sacos; o vosso dinheiro me chegou a mim. E trouxe-lhes fora a Simeão.\\nDepois, levou o varão aqueles varões à casa de José e deu-{lhes} água, e lavaram os seus pés; também deu pasto aos seus jumentos.\\nE prepararam o presente, para quando José viesse ao meio-dia; porque tinham ouvido que ali haviam de comer pão.\\nVindo, pois, José à casa, trouxeram-lhe ali o presente que estava na sua mão; e inclinaram-se a ele até à terra.\\nE ele lhes perguntou como estavam e disse: Vosso pai, o velho de quem falastes, está bem? Ainda vive?\\nE eles disseram: Bem está o teu servo, nosso pai vive ainda. E abaixaram a cabeça e inclinaram-se.\\nE ele levantou os olhos, e viu a Benjamim, seu irmão, filho de sua mãe, e disse: Este {é} o vosso irmão mais novo, de quem me falastes? Depois, ele disse: Deus te abençoe, meu filho.\\nE José apressou-se, porque o seu íntimo moveu-se para o seu irmão; e procurou {onde} chorar, e entrou na câmara, e chorou ali.\\nDepois, lavou o rosto e saiu; e conteve-se e disse: Ponde pão.\\nE puseram-lhe {a ele} à parte, e a eles à parte, e aos egípcios que comiam com ele à parte; porque os egípcios não podem comer pão com os hebreus, porquanto é abominação para os egípcios.\\nE assentaram-se diante dele, o primogênito segundo a sua primogenitura e o menor segundo a sua menoridade; do que os varões se maravilhavam entre si.\\nE apresentou-lhe as porções que {estavam} diante dele; porém a porção de Benjamim era cinco vezes maior do que a de qualquer deles. E eles beberam e se regalaram com ele.\\nE deu ordem ao que estava sobre a sua casa, dizendo: Enche de mantimento os sacos destes varões, quanto puderem levar, e põe o dinheiro de cada varão na boca do seu saco.\\nE o meu copo, o copo de prata, porás na boca do saco do mais novo, com o dinheiro do seu trigo. E fez conforme a palavra de José, que tinha dito.\\nVinda a luz da manhã, despediram-se estes varões, eles com os seus jumentos.\\nSaindo eles da cidade {e} não se havendo ainda distanciado, disse José ao que {estava} sobre a sua casa: Levanta-te e persegue aqueles varões; e, alcançando-os, lhes dirás: Por que pagastes mal por bem?\\nNão {é} este o {copo} por que bebe meu senhor? E em que ele bem adivinha? Fizestes mal no que fizestes.\\nE alcançou-os e falou-lhes as mesmas palavras.\\nE eles disseram-lhe: Por que diz meu senhor tais palavras? Longe estejam teus servos de fazerem semelhante coisa.\\nEis que o dinheiro que temos achado na boca dos nossos sacos te tornamos a trazer desde a terra de Canaã; como, pois, furtaríamos da casa do teu senhor prata ou ouro?\\nAquele dos teus servos, com quem for achado, morra; e ainda nós seremos escravos do meu senhor.\\nE ele disse: Ora, seja também assim conforme as vossas palavras; aquele com quem se achar será meu escravo, porém vós sereis desculpados.\\nE eles apressaram-se, e cada um pôs em terra o seu saco, e cada um abriu o seu saco.\\nE buscou, começando no maior e acabando no mais novo; e achou-se o copo no saco de Benjamim.\\nEntão, rasgaram as suas vestes, e carregou cada um o seu jumento, e tornaram à cidade.\\nE veio Judá com os seus irmãos à casa de José, porque ele ainda estava ali; e prostraram-se diante dele em terra.\\nE disse-lhes José: Que {é} isto que fizestes? Não sabeis vós que tal homem como eu bem adivinha?\\nEntão, disse Judá: Que diremos a meu senhor? Que falaremos? E como nos justificaremos? Achou Deus a iniqüidade de teus servos; eis que {somos} escravos de meu senhor, tanto nós como aquele em cuja mão foi achado o copo.\\nMas ele disse: Longe de mim que eu tal faça; o varão em cuja mão o copo foi achado, aquele será meu servo; porém vós subi em paz para vosso pai.\\nEntão, Judá se chegou a ele e disse: Ai! Senhor meu, deixa, peço-te, o teu servo dizer uma palavra aos ouvidos de meu senhor, e não se acenda a tua ira contra o teu servo; porque tu {és} como Faraó.\\nMeu senhor perguntou a seus servos, dizendo: Tendes vós pai ou irmão?\\nE dissemos a meu senhor: Temos um velho pai e um moço da sua velhice, o mais novo, cujo irmão é morto; e só ele ficou de sua mãe, e seu pai o ama.\\nEntão, tu disseste a teus servos: Trazei-mo a mim, e porei os meus olhos sobre ele.\\nE nós dissemos a meu senhor: Aquele moço não poderá deixar a seu pai; se deixar a seu pai, {este} morrerá.\\nEntão, tu disseste a teus servos: Se vosso irmão mais novo não descer convosco, nunca mais vereis a minha face.\\nE aconteceu que, subindo nós a teu servo, meu pai, e contando-lhe as palavras de meu senhor,\\ndisse nosso pai: Tornai, comprai-nos um pouco de mantimento.\\nE nós dissemos: Não poderemos descer; mas, se nosso irmão menor for conosco, desceremos; pois não poderemos ver a face do varão, se este nosso irmão menor não {estiver} conosco.\\nEntão, disse-nos teu servo, meu pai: Vós sabeis que minha mulher me deu dois filhos;\\num ausentou-se de mim, e eu disse: Certamente foi despedaçado, e não o tenho visto até agora;\\nse agora também tirardes a este da minha face, e lhe acontecer algum desastre, fareis descer as minhas cãs com dor à sepultura.\\nAgora, pois, indo eu a teu servo, meu pai, e o moço não indo conosco, como a sua alma está atada com a alma dele,\\nacontecerá que, vendo ele que o moço ali não {está,} morrerá; e teus servos farão descer as cãs de teu servo, nosso pai, com tristeza à sepultura.\\nPorque teu servo se deu por fiador por este moço para com meu pai, dizendo: Se não to tornar, eu serei culpado a meu pai todos os dias.\\nAgora, pois, fique teu servo em lugar deste moço por escravo de meu senhor, e que suba o moço com os seus irmãos.\\nPorque como subirei eu a meu pai, se o moço não {for} comigo? Para que não veja eu o mal que sobrevirá a meu pai.\\nEntão, José não se podia conter diante de todos os que estavam com ele; e clamou: Fazei sair daqui a todo varão; e ninguém ficou com ele quando José se deu a conhecer a seus irmãos.\\nE levantou a sua voz com choro, de maneira que os egípcios o ouviam, e a casa de Faraó o ouviu.\\nE disse José a seus irmãos: Eu {sou} José; vive ainda meu pai? E seus irmãos não lhe puderam responder, porque estavam pasmados diante da sua face.\\nE disse José a seus irmãos: Peço-vos, chegai-vos a mim. E chegaram-se. Então, disse ele: Eu {sou} José, vosso irmão, a quem vendestes para o Egito.\\nAgora, pois, não vos entristeçais, nem vos pese aos vossos olhos por me haverdes vendido para cá; porque, para conservação da vida, Deus me enviou diante da vossa face.\\nPorque já houve dois anos de fome no meio da terra, e ainda {restam} cinco anos em que não haverá lavoura nem sega.\\nPelo que Deus me enviou diante da vossa face, para conservar vossa sucessão na terra e para guardar-vos em vida por um grande livramento.\\nAssim, não {fostes} vós {que} me enviastes para cá, senão Deus, que me tem posto por pai de Faraó, e por senhor de toda a sua casa, e como regente {ou governador} em toda a terra do Egito.\\nApressai-vos, e subi a meu pai, e dizei-lhe: Assim tem dito o teu filho José: Deus me tem posto por senhor em toda a terra do Egito; desce a mim e não te demores.\\nE habitarás na terra de Gósen e estarás perto de mim, tu e os teus filhos, e os filhos dos teus filhos, e as tuas ovelhas, e as tuas vacas, e tudo o que tens.\\nE ali te sustentarei, porque ainda {haverá} cinco anos de fome, para que não pereças de pobreza, tu, e tua casa, e tudo o que tens.\\nE eis que vossos olhos vêem, e os olhos de meu irmão Benjamim, {que é} minha boca que vos fala.\\nE fazei saber a meu pai toda a minha glória no Egito e tudo o que tendes visto; e apressai-vos a fazer descer meu pai para cá.\\nE lançou-se ao pescoço de Benjamim, seu irmão, e chorou; e Benjamim chorou {também} ao seu pescoço.\\nE beijou todos os seus irmãos e chorou sobre eles; e, depois, seus irmãos falaram com ele.\\nE a nova ouviu-se na casa de Faraó, dizendo: Os irmãos de José são vindos; e pareceu bem aos olhos de Faraó e aos olhos de seus servos.\\nE disse Faraó a José: Dize a teus irmãos: Fazei isto: carregai os vossos animais, e parti, e tornai à terra de Canaã,\\ne tornai a vosso pai e a vossas famílias, e vinde a mim; e eu vos darei o melhor da terra do Egito, e comereis a fartura da terra.\\nA ti, pois, é ordenado; fazei isto: tomai vós da terra do Egito carros para vossos meninos, para vossas mulheres e para vosso pai e vinde.\\nE não vos pese {coisa alguma} das vossas alfaias; porque o melhor de toda a terra do Egito {será} vosso.\\nE os filhos de Israel fizeram assim. E José deu-lhes carros, conforme o mandado de Faraó; também lhes deu comida para o caminho.\\nA todos lhes deu, a cada um, mudas de vestes; mas a Benjamim deu trezentas peças de prata e cinco mudas de vestes.\\nE a seu pai enviou semelhantemente dez jumentos carregados do melhor do Egito, e dez jumentos carregados de trigo, e pão, e comida para seu pai, para o caminho.\\nE despediu os seus irmãos, e partiram; e disse-lhes: Não contendais pelo caminho.\\nE subiram do Egito e vieram à terra de Canaã, a Jacó, seu pai.\\nEntão, lhe anunciaram, dizendo: José ainda vive e ele também é regente em toda a terra do Egito. E o seu coração desmaiou, porque não os acreditava.\\nPorém, havendo-lhe eles contado todas as palavras de José que ele lhes falara, e vendo ele os carros que José enviara para levá-lo, reviveu o espírito de Jacó, seu pai.\\nE disse Israel: Basta; ainda vive meu filho José; eu irei e o verei antes que eu morra.\\nE partiu Israel com tudo quanto tinha, e veio a Berseba, e ofereceu sacrifícios ao Deus de Isaque, seu pai.\\nE falou Deus a Israel em visões, de noite, e disse: Jacó! Jacó! E ele disse: Eis-me {aqui.}\\nE disse: Eu {sou} Deus, o Deus de teu pai; não temas descer ao Egito, porque eu te farei ali uma grande nação.\\nE descerei contigo ao Egito e certamente te farei {tornar} a subir; e José porá a sua mão sobre os teus olhos.\\nEntão, levantou-se Jacó de Berseba; e os filhos de Israel levaram Jacó, seu pai, e seus meninos, e as suas mulheres, nos carros que Faraó enviara para o levar.\\nE tomaram o seu gado e a sua fazenda que tinham adquirido na terra de Canaã e vieram ao Egito, Jacó e toda a sua semente com ele.\\nOs seus filhos, e os filhos de seus filhos com ele, as suas filhas, e as filhas de seus filhos, e toda a sua semente levou consigo ao Egito.\\nE estes {são} os nomes dos filhos de Israel, que vieram ao Egito, Jacó e seus filhos: Rúben, o primogênito de Jacó,\\ne os filhos de Rúben: Enoque, e Palu, e Hezrom, e Carmi.\\nE os filhos de Simeão: Jemuel, e Jamim, e Oade, e Jaquim, e Zoar, e Saul, filho de uma mulher cananéia.\\nE os filhos de Levi: Gérson, Coate e Merari.\\nE os filhos de Judá: Er, e Onã, e Selá, e Perez, e Zerá. Er e Onã, porém, morreram na terra de Canaã; e os filhos de Perez foram Esrom e Hamul.\\nE os filhos de Issacar: Tola, e Puva, e Jó, e Sinrom.\\nE os filhos de Zebulom: Serede, e Elom, e Jaleel.\\nEstes {são} os filhos de Léia, que deu a Jacó em Padã-Arã, com Diná, sua filha; todas as almas de seus filhos e de suas filhas {foram} trinta e três.\\nE os filhos de Gade: Zifiom, e Hagi, e Suni, e Esbom, e Eri, e Arodi, e Areli.\\nE os filhos de Aser: Imna, e Isvá, e Isvi, e Berias, e Será, a irmã deles; e os filhos de Berias: Héber e Malquiel.\\nEstes são os filhos de Zilpa, a qual Labão deu à sua filha Léia e que deu a Jacó estas dezesseis almas.\\nOs filhos de Raquel, mulher de Jacó: José e Benjamim.\\nE nasceram a José na terra do Egito Manassés e Efraim, que lhe deu Asenate, filha de Potífera, sacerdote de Om.\\nE os filhos de Benjamim: Belá, e Bequer, e Asbel, e Gera, e Naamã, e Eí, e Rôs, e Mupim, e Hupim, e Arde.\\nEstes são os filhos de Raquel, que nasceram a Jacó, ao todo catorze almas.\\nE o filho de Dã: Husim.\\nE os filhos de Naftali: Jazeel, e Guni, e Jezer, e Silém.\\nEstes são os filhos de Bila, a qual Labão deu à sua filha Raquel e que deu estes a Jacó; todas as almas foram sete.\\nTodas as almas que vieram com Jacó ao Egito, que descenderam dele, fora as mulheres dos filhos de Jacó, todas foram sessenta e seis almas.\\nE os filhos de José, que lhe nasceram no Egito, {eram} duas almas. Todas as almas da casa de Jacó, que vieram ao Egito, {foram} setenta.\\nE {Jacó} enviou Judá diante da sua face a José, para o encaminhar a Gósen; e chegaram à terra de Gósen.\\nEntão, José aprontou o seu carro e subiu ao encontro de Israel, seu pai, a Gósen. E, mostrando-se-lhe, lançou-se ao seu pescoço e chorou sobre o seu pescoço, longo tempo.\\nE Israel disse a José: Morra eu agora, pois já tenho visto o teu rosto, que ainda vives.\\nDepois, disse José a seus irmãos e à casa de seu pai: Eu subirei, e anunciarei a Faraó, e lhe direi: Meus irmãos e a casa de meu pai, que {estavam} na terra de Canaã, vieram a mim.\\nE os varões {são} pastores de ovelhas, porque são homens de gado, e trouxeram consigo as suas ovelhas, e as suas vacas, e tudo o que têm.\\nQuando, pois, acontecer que Faraó vos chamar e disser: Qual {é} o vosso negócio? {ou ocupação}\\nEntão, direis: Teus servos foram homens de gado desde a nossa mocidade até agora, tanto nós como os nossos pais; para que habiteis na terra de Gósen, porque todo o pastor de ovelhas {é} abominação para os egípcios.\\nEntão, veio José, e anunciou a Faraó, e disse: Meu pai, e os meus irmãos, e as suas ovelhas, e as suas vacas, com tudo o que têm, chegaram da terra de Canaã, e eis que {estão} na terra de Gósen.\\nE tomou uma parte de seus irmãos, a {saber,} cinco varões, e os pôs diante de Faraó.\\nEntão, disse Faraó a seus irmãos: Qual é o vosso negócio? E eles disseram a Faraó: Teus servos {são} pastores de ovelhas, tanto nós como nossos pais.\\nDisseram mais a Faraó: Viemos para peregrinar nesta terra; porque não há pasto para as ovelhas de teus servos, porquanto a fome {é} grave na terra de Canaã; agora, pois, rogamos-te que teus servos habitem na terra de Gósen.\\nEntão, falou Faraó a José, dizendo: Teu pai e teus irmãos vieram a ti.\\nA terra do Egito está diante da tua face; no melhor da terra faze habitar teu pai e teus irmãos; habitem na terra de Gósen; e, se sabes que entre eles há homens valentes, {ou aptos} os porás por maiorais do gado, sobre o que eu tenho.\\nE trouxe José a Jacó, seu pai, e o pôs diante de Faraó; e Jacó abençoou a Faraó.\\nE Faraó disse a Jacó: Quantos {são} os dias dos anos de tua vida?\\nE Jacó disse a Faraó: Os dias dos anos das minhas peregrinações {são} cento e trinta anos; poucos e maus foram os dias dos anos da minha vida e não chegaram aos dias dos anos da vida de meus pais, nos dias das suas peregrinações.\\nE Jacó abençoou a Faraó e saiu de diante da face de Faraó.\\nE José fez habitar a seu pai e seus irmãos e deu-lhes possessão na terra do Egito, no melhor da terra, na terra de Ramessés, como Faraó ordenara.\\nE José sustentou de pão a seu pai, e a seus irmãos, e a toda a casa de seu pai, segundo as suas famílias.\\nE não {havia} pão em toda a terra, porque a fome {era} mui grave; de maneira que a terra do Egito e a terra de Canaã desfaleciam por causa da fome.\\nEntão, José recolheu todo o dinheiro que se achou na terra do Egito e na terra de Canaã, pelo trigo que compravam; e José trouxe o dinheiro à casa de Faraó.\\nAcabando-se, pois, o dinheiro na terra do Egito e na terra de Canaã, vieram todos os egípcios a José, dizendo: Dá-nos pão; por que morreremos em tua presença? Porquanto o dinheiro nos falta.\\nE José disse: Dai o vosso gado, e eu vo-lo darei por vosso gado, se falta o dinheiro.\\nEntão, trouxeram o seu gado a José; e José deu-lhes pão em {troca} de cavalos, e das ovelhas, e das vacas, e dos jumentos; e os sustentou de pão aquele ano por todo o seu gado.\\nE, acabado aquele ano, vieram a ele no segundo ano e disseram-lhe: Não ocultaremos ao meu senhor que o dinheiro é acabado, e meu senhor possui os animais; nenhuma outra coisa {nos} ficou diante da face de meu senhor, senão o nosso corpo e a nossa terra.\\nPor que morreremos diante dos teus olhos, tanto nós como a nossa terra? Compra-nos a nós e à nossa terra por pão, e nós e a nossa terra seremos servos de Faraó; dá semente para que vivamos e não morramos, e a terra não se desole.\\nAssim, José comprou toda a terra do Egito para Faraó, porque os egípcios venderam cada um o seu campo, porquanto a fome era extrema sobre eles; e a terra ficou {sendo} de Faraó.\\nE, quanto ao povo, fê-lo passar às cidades, desde {uma} extremidade da terra do Egito até à {outra} extremidade.\\nSomente a terra dos sacerdotes não a comprou, porquanto os sacerdotes tinham porção de Faraó e eles comiam a sua porção que Faraó lhes tinha dado; por isso, não venderam a sua terra.\\nEntão, disse José ao povo: Eis que hoje vos tenho comprado a vós e a vossa terra para Faraó; eis aí tendes semente para vós, para que semeeis a terra.\\nHá de ser, porém, que das colheitas dareis o quinto a Faraó, e as quatro partes serão vossas, para semente do campo, e para o vosso mantimento, e dos que {estão} nas vossas casas, e para que comam vossos meninos.\\nE disseram: A vida nos tens dado; achemos graça aos olhos de meu senhor e seremos servos de Faraó.\\nJosé, pois, pôs isto por estatuto, até ao dia de hoje, sobre a terra do Egito: que Faraó tirasse o quinto; só a terra dos sacerdotes não ficou {sendo} de Faraó.\\nAssim, habitou Israel na terra do Egito, na terra de Gósen, e nela tomaram possessão, e frutificaram, e multiplicaram-se muito.\\nE Jacó viveu na terra do Egito dezessete anos; de sorte que os dias de Jacó, os anos da sua vida, foram cento e quarenta e sete anos.\\nChegando-se, pois, o tempo da morte de Israel, chamou a José, seu filho, e disse-lhe: Se agora tenho achado graça aos teus olhos, rogo-te que ponhas a tua mão debaixo da minha coxa, e usa comigo de beneficência e verdade; rogo-te que me não enterres no Egito,\\nmas que {eu} jaza com os meus pais; por isso, me levarás do Egito e me sepultarás na sepultura deles. E ele disse: Farei conforme a tua palavra.\\nE disse ele: Jura-me. E ele jurou-lhe; e Israel inclinou-se sobre a cabeceira da cama.\\nE aconteceu, depois destas coisas, que disseram a José: Eis que teu pai está enfermo. Então, tomou consigo os seus dois filhos, Manassés e Efraim.\\nE um deu parte a Jacó e disse: Eis que José, teu filho, vem a ti. E esforçou-se Israel e assentou-se sobre a cama.\\nE Jacó disse a José: O Deus Todo-poderoso me apareceu em Luz, na terra de Canaã, e me abençoou,\\ne me disse: Eis que te farei frutificar e multiplicar, e te porei por multidão de povos, e darei esta terra à tua semente depois de ti, em possessão perpétua.\\nAgora, pois, os teus dois filhos, que te nasceram na terra do Egito, antes que eu viesse a ti no Egito, {são} meus; Efraim e Manassés serão meus, como Rúben e Simeão.\\nMas a tua geração, que gerarás depois deles, será tua; segundo o nome de seus irmãos serão chamados na sua herança.\\nVindo, pois, eu de Padã, me morreu Raquel na terra de Canaã, no caminho, quando ainda {ficava um pequeno} espaço de terra para vir a Efrata; e eu a sepultei ali, no caminho de Efrata, que {é} Belém.\\nE Israel viu os filhos de José e disse: Quem {são} estes?\\nE José disse a seu pai: Eles {são} meus filhos, que Deus me tem dado aqui. E ele disse: Peço-te, traze-mos aqui, para que os abençoe.\\nOs olhos, porém, de Israel eram carregados de velhice, já não podia ver bem; e fê-los chegar a ele, e beijou-os e abraçou-os.\\nE Israel disse a José: Eu não cuidara ver o teu rosto; e eis que Deus me fez ver a tua semente também.\\nEntão, José os tirou de seus joelhos e inclinou-se à terra diante da sua face.\\nE tomou José a ambos, a Efraim na sua mão direita, à esquerda de Israel, e a Manassés na sua mão esquerda, à direita de Israel, e fê-los chegar a ele.\\nMas Israel estendeu a sua mão direita e a pôs sobre a cabeça de Efraim, ainda que era o menor, e a sua esquerda sobre a cabeça de Manassés, dirigindo as suas mãos avisadamente, ainda que Manassés {era} o primogênito.\\nE abençoou a José e disse: O Deus, em cuja presença andaram os meus pais Abraão e Isaque, o Deus que me sustentou, desde que eu nasci até este dia,\\no Anjo que me livrou {ou remiu} de todo o mal, abençoe estes rapazes; e seja chamado neles o meu nome e o nome de meus pais Abraão e Isaque; e multipliquem-se, como peixes em multidão, no meio da terra.\\nVendo, pois, José que seu pai punha a sua mão direita sobre a cabeça de Efraim, foi mau aos seus olhos; e tomou a mão de seu pai, para a transpor de sobre a cabeça de Efraim à cabeça de Manassés.\\nE José disse a seu pai: Não assim, meu pai, porque este {é} o primogênito; põe a tua mão direita sobre a sua cabeça.\\nMas seu pai {o} recusou e disse: Eu o sei, filho meu, eu o sei; também ele será um povo e também ele será grande; contudo, o seu irmão menor será maior que ele, e a sua semente será uma multidão {Heb. plenitude} de nações.\\nAssim, os abençoou naquele dia, dizendo: Em ti Israel abençoará, dizendo: Deus te ponha como a Efraim e como a Manassés. E pôs a Efraim diante de Manassés.\\nDepois, disse Israel a José: Eis que eu morro, mas Deus será convosco e vos fará tornar à terra de vossos pais.\\nE eu te tenho dado a ti um pedaço de terra mais que a teus irmãos, o qual tomei com a minha espada e com o meu arco da mão dos amorreus.\\nDepois, chamou Jacó a seus filhos e disse: Ajuntai-vos, e anunciar-vos-ei o que vos há de acontecer nos derradeiros dias;\\najuntai-vos e ouvi, filhos de Jacó; e ouvi a Israel, vosso pai:\\nRúben, tu {és} meu primogênito, minha força e o princípio de meu vigor, o {mais} excelente em alteza e o {mais} excelente em poder.\\nInconstante como a água, não serás o {mais} excelente, porquanto subiste ao leito de teu pai. Então, o contaminaste; subiste à minha cama.\\nSimeão e Levi {são} irmãos; as suas espadas {são} instrumentos de violência.\\nNo seu secreto conselho, não entre minha alma; com a sua congregação, minha glória não se ajunte; porque, no seu furor, mataram varões e, na sua teima, arrebataram bois.\\nMaldito {seja} o seu furor, pois era forte, e a sua ira, pois era dura; eu os dividirei em Jacó e os espalharei em Israel.\\nJudá, a ti te louvarão os teus irmãos; a tua mão {será} sobre o pescoço de seus inimigos; os filhos de teu pai a ti se inclinarão.\\nJudá {é} um leãozinho; da presa subiste, filho meu.

Agora, pois, te peço, que eu suba, para que sepulte o meu pai; então, voltarei.\\nE Faraó disse: Sobe e sepulta o teu pai, como ele te fez jurar.\\nE José subiu para sepultar o seu pai; e subiram com ele todos os servos de Faraó, os anciãos da sua casa e todos os anciãos da terra do Egito,\\ncomo também toda a casa de José, e seus irmãos, e a casa de seu pai; somente deixaram na terra de Gósen os seus meninos, e as suas ovelhas, e as suas vacas.\\nE subiram também com ele tanto carros como gente a cavalo; e o concurso foi grandíssimo.\\nChegando eles, pois, à eira {ou eira de Atade} do espinhal, que {está} além do Jordão, fizeram um grande e gravíssimo pranto; e fez a seu pai um grande pranto por sete dias.\\nE, vendo os moradores da terra, os cananeus, o luto na eira do espinhal, disseram: É este o pranto grande dos egípcios. Por isso, chamou-se o seu nome Abel-Mizraim, que {está} além do Jordão.\\nE fizeram-lhe os seus filhos assim como ele lhes ordenara,\\npois os seus filhos o levaram à terra de Canaã e o sepultaram na cova do campo de Macpela, que Abraão tinha comprado com o campo, por herança de sepultura, a Efrom, o heteu, em frente de Manre.\\nDepois, tornou José para o Egito, ele, e seus irmãos, e todos os que com ele subiram a sepultar o seu pai, depois de haver sepultado o seu pai.\\nVendo, então, os irmãos de José que o seu pai já estava morto, disseram: Porventura, nos aborrecerá José e nos pagará certamente todo o mal que lhe fizemos.\\nPortanto, enviaram a José, dizendo: Teu pai mandou, antes da sua morte, dizendo:\\nAssim direis a José: Perdoa, rogo-te, a transgressão de teus irmãos e o seu pecado, porque te fizeram mal; agora, pois, rogamos-te que perdoes a transgressão dos servos do Deus de teu pai. E José chorou quando eles lhe falavam.\\nDepois, vieram também seus irmãos, e prostraram-se diante dele, e disseram: Eis-nos aqui por teus servos.\\nE José lhes disse: Não temais; porque, porventura, {estou} eu em lugar de Deus?\\nVós bem intentastes mal contra mim, {porém} Deus o tornou em bem, para fazer como se vê neste dia, para conservar em vida a um povo grande.\\nAgora, pois, não temais; eu vos sustentarei a vós e a vossos meninos. Assim, os consolou e falou segundo o coração deles.\\nJosé, pois, habitou no Egito, ele e a casa de seu pai; e viveu José cento e dez anos.\\nE viu José os filhos de Efraim, da terceira {geração;} também os filhos de Maquir, filho de Manassés, nasceram sobre os joelhos de José.\\nE disse José a seus irmãos: Eu morro, mas Deus certamente vos visitará e vos fará subir desta terra para a terra que jurou a Abraão, a Isaque e a Jacó.\\nE José fez jurar os filhos de Israel, dizendo: Certamente, vos visitará Deus, e fareis transportar os meus ossos daqui.\\nE morreu José da idade de cento e dez anos; e o embalsamaram e o puseram num caixão no Egito.\\nI begynnelsen skapade Gud himmel och jord.\\nOch jorden var öde och tom, och mörker var över djupet, och Guds\\nAnde svävade över vattnet.\\nOch Gud sade: ╜Varde ljus╜; och det vart ljus.\\nOch Gud såg att ljuset var gott; och Gud skilde ljuset från\\nmörkret.\\nOch Gud kallade ljuset dag, och mörkret kallade han natt.

Och HERREN såg till Abel och hans offergåva;\\nmen till Kain och hans offergåva såg han icke.  Då blev Kain\\nmycket vred, och hans blick blev mörk.\\nOch HERREN sade till Kain: ╜Varför är du vred, och varför är din\\nblick så mörk?\\nÄr det icke så: om du har gott i sinnet, då ser du frimodigt\\nupp; men om du icke har gott i sinnet, då lurar synden vid\\ndörren; till dig står hennes åtrå, men du bör råda över henne.╜\\nOch Kain talade med sin broder Abel; och när de voro ute på\\nmarken, överföll Kain sin broder Abel och dräpte honom.\\n\\nDå sade HERREN till Kain: ╜Var är din broder Abel?╜  Han svarade:\\n╜Jag vet icke; skall jag taga vara på min broder?╜\\nDå sade han: ╜Vad har du gjort!

Och Gud lät en vind gå\\nfram över jorden, så att vattnet sjönk undan;\\noch djupets källor och himmelens fönster tillslötos, och regnet\\nfrån himmelen upphörde.\\nOch vattnet vek bort ifrån jorden mer och mer; efter hundra\\nfemtio dagar begynte vattnet avtaga.\\nOch i sjunde månaden, på sjuttonde dagen i månaden, stannade\\narken på Ararats berg.\\nOch vattnet avtog mer och mer intill tionde månaden.  I tionde\\nmånaden, på första dagen i månaden, blevo bergstopparna synliga.\\nOch efter fyrtio dagar öppnade Noa fönstret som han hade gjort\\npå arken,\\noch lät en korp flyga ut; denne flög fram och åter, till dess\\nvattnet hade torkat bort ifrån jorden.\\nSedan lät han en duva flyga ut, för att få se om vattnet hade\\nsjunkit undan från marken.\\nMen duvan fann ingen plats där hon kunde vila sin fot, utan kom\\ntillbaka till honom i arken, ty vatten betäckte hela jorden.  Då\\nräckte han ut sin hand och tog henne in till sig i arken.\\nSedan väntade han ännu ytterligare sju dagar och lät så duvan än\\nen gång flyga ut ur arken.\\nOch duvan kom till honom mot aftonen, och se, då hade hon ett\\nfriskt olivlöv i sin näbb.  Då förstod Noa att vattnet hade\\nsjunkit undan från jorden.\\nMen han väntade ännu ytterligare sju dagar och lät så duvan åter\\nflyga ut; då kom hon icke mer tillbaka till honom.\\n\\nI det sexhundraförsta året, i första månaden, på första dagen i\\nmånaden, hade vattnet sinat bort ifrån jorden.  Då tog Noa av\\ntaket på arken och såg nu att marken var fri ifrån vatten.\\nOch i andra månaden, på tjugusjunde dagen i månaden, var jorden\\nalldeles torr.\\nDå talade Gud till Noa och sade:\\n╜Gå ut ur arken med din hustru och dina söner och dina söners\\nhustrur.\\nAlla djur som du har hos dig, vad slags kött det vara må, både\\nfåglar och fyrfotadjur och alla kräldjur som röra sig på\\njorden, skall du låta gå ut med dig, för att de må växa till på\\njorden och vara fruktsamma och föröka sig på jorden.╜\\nSå gick då Noa ut med sina söner och sin hustru och sina söners\\nhustrur.\\nOch alla fyrfotadjur, alla kräldjur och alla fåglar, alla slags\\ndjur som röra sig på jorden, gingo ut ur arken, efter sina\\nsläkten.\\n\\nOch Noa byggde ett altare åt HERREN och tog av alla rena\\nfyrfotadjur och av alla rena fåglar och offrade brännoffer på\\naltaret.\\nNär HERREN kände den välbehagliga lukten, sade han vid sig\\nsjälv: ╜Jag skall härefter icke mer förbanna marken för\\nmänniskans skull, eftersom ju människans hjärtas uppsåt är ont\\nallt ifrån ungdomen.

Och Lot bröt upp\\noch drog österut, och de skildes så från varandra.\\nAbram förblev boende i Kanaans land, och Lot bodde i städerna på\\nSlätten och drog med sina tält ända inemot Sodom.\\nMen folket i Sodom var mycket ont och syndigt inför HERREN.\\n\\nOch HERREN sade till Abram, sedan Lot hade skilt sig från honom:\\n╜Lyft upp dina ögon och se, från den plats där du står, mot norr\\noch söder och öster och väster.╜\\nTy hela det land som du nu ser skall jag giva åt dig och din säd\\nför evärdlig tid.\\nOch jag skall låta din säd bliva såsom stoftet på jorden; kan\\nnågon räkna stoftet på jorden, så skall ock din säd kunna\\nräknas.\\nStå upp och drag igenom landet efter dess längd och dess bredd,\\nty åt dig skall jag giva det.╜\\nOch Abram drog åstad med sina tält och kom och bosatte sig vid\\nMamres terebintlund invid Hebron; och han byggde där ett altare\\nåt HERREN.\\nPå den tid då Amrafel var konung i Sinear, Arjok konung i\\nEllasar, Kedorlaomer konung i Elam och Tideal konung över Goim,\\nhände sig\\natt dessa begynte krig mot Bera, konungen i Sodom, Birsa,\\nkonungen i Gomorra, Sinab, konungen i Adma, Semeber, konungen i\\nSeboim, och mot konungen i Bela, det är Soar.\\nDe förenade sig alla och tågade till Siddimsdalen, där Salthavet\\nnu är.\\nI tolv år hade de varit under Kedorlaomer, men i det trettonde\\nåret hade de avfallit.\\nSå kom nu i det fjortonde året Kedorlaomer med de konungar som\\nvoro på hans sida; och de slogo rafaéerna i Asterot-Karnaim,\\nsuséerna i Ham, eméerna i Save-Kirjataim\\noch horéerna på deras berg Seir och drevo dem ända till El-Paran\\nvid öknen.\\nSedan vände de om och kommo till En-Mispat, det är Kades, och\\nhärjade amalekiternas hela land; de slogo ock amoréerna som\\nbodde i Hasason-Tamar.\\nDå drogo konungen i Sodom, konungen i Gomorra, konungen i Adma,\\nkonungen i Seboim och konungen i Bela, det är Soar, ut och\\nställde upp sig i Siddimsdalen till strid mot dem --\\nmot Kedorlaomer, konungen i Elam, Tideal, konungen över Goim,\\nAmrafel, konungen i Sinear, och Arjok, konungen i Ellasar, fyra\\nkonungar mot de fem.\\nMen Siddimsdalen var full av jordbecksgropar.  Och konungarna i\\nSodom och Gomorra måste fly och föllo då i dessa, och de som\\nkommo undan flydde till bergsbygden.\\nSå togo de allt gods som fanns i Sodom och Gomorra, och alla\\nlivsmedel där, och tågade bort;\\nde togo ock med sig Lot, Abrams brorson, och hans ägodelar, när\\nde tågade bort; ty denne bodde i Sodom.\\nMen en av de räddade kom och berättade detta för Abram, hebréen;\\ndenne bodde vid den terebintlund som tillhörde amoréen Mamre,\\nEskols och Aners broder, och dessa voro i förbund med Abram.\\nDå nu Abram hörde att hans frände var fången, lät han sina mest\\nbeprövade tjänare, sådana som voro födda i hans hus, tre hundra\\naderton män, rycka ut, och förföljde fienderna ända till Dan.\\nOch han delade sitt folk och överföll dem så om natten med sina\\ntjänare och slog dem, och förföljde dem sedan ända till Hoba,\\nnorr om Damaskus,\\noch tog tillbaka allt godset; sin frände Lot och hans ägodelar\\ntog han ock tillbaka, ävensom kvinnorna och det övriga folket.\\n\\nDå han nu var på återvägen, sedan han hade slagit Kedorlaomer\\noch de konungar som voro på hans sida, gick konungen i Sodom\\nhonom till mötes i Savedalen, det är Konungsdalen.\\nOch Melki-Sedek, konungen i Salem, lät bära ut bröd och vin;\\ndenne var präst åt Gud den Högste.\\nOch han välsignade honom och sade: ╜Välsignad vare Abram av Gud\\nden Högste, himmelens och jordens skapare!\\nOch välsignad vare Gud den Högste, som har givit dina ovänner i\\ndin hand!╜  Och Abram gav honom tionde av allt.\\nOch konungen i Sodom sade till Abram: ╜Giv mig folket; godset må\\ndu behålla för dig själv.╜\\nMen Abram svarade konungen i Sodom: ╜Jag lyfter min hand upp\\ntill HERREN, till Gud den Högste, himmelens och jordens skapare,\\noch betygar\\natt jag icke vill taga ens en tråd eller en skorem, än mindre\\nnågot annat som tillhör dig.  Du skall icke kunna säga: \\'Jag har\\nriktat Abram.\\'\\nJag vill intet hava; det är nog med vad mina män hava förtärt\\noch den del som tillkommer mina följeslagare.

Jag går\\nju barnlös bort, och arvinge till mitt hus bliver en man från\\nDamaskus, Elieser.╜\\nOch Abram sade ytterligare: ╜Mig har du icke givit någon\\nlivsfrukt; en av mitt husfolk skall bliva min arvinge.╜\\nMen se, HERRENS ord kom till honom; han sade: ╜Nej, denne skall\\nicke bliva din arvinge, utan en som utgår från ditt eget liv\\nskall bliva din arvinge.╜\\nOch han förde honom ut och sade: ╜Skåda upp till himmelen, och\\nräkna stjärnorna, om du kan räkna dem.╜  Och han sade till\\nhonom: ╜Så skall din säd bliva.╜\\nOch han trodde på HERREN; och han räknade honom det till\\nrättfärdighet.\\n\\nOch han sade till honom: ╜Jag är HERREN, som har fört dig ut\\nfrån det kaldeiska Ur för att giva dig detta land till\\nbesittning.╜\\nHan svarade: ╜Herre, HERRE, varav skall jag veta att jag skall\\nbesitta det?╜\\nDå sade han till honom: ╜Tag åt mig en treårig kviga, en treårig\\nget och en treårig vädur, därtill en turturduva och en ung\\nduva.╜\\nOch han tog åt honom alla dessa djur och styckade dem mitt itu\\noch lade styckena mitt emot varandra; dock styckade han icke\\nfåglarna.\\nOch rovfåglarna slogo ned på de döda kropparna, men Abram drev\\nbort dem.\\n\\nNär nu solen var nära att gå ned och en tung sömn hade fallit på\\nAbram, se, då kom en förskräckelse över honom och ett stort\\nmörker.\\nOch han sade till Abram: ╜Det skall du veta, att din säd skall\\nkomma att leva såsom främlingar i ett land som icke tillhör dem,\\noch de skola där vara trälar, och man skall förtrycka dem; så\\nskall ske i fyra hundra år.╜\\nMen det folk vars trälar de bliva skall jag ock döma.

Men hon\\nhade en egyptisk tjänstekvinna, som hette Hagar;\\noch Sarai sade till Abram: ╜Se, HERREN har gjort mig ofruktsam,\\nså att jag icke föder barn; gå in till min tjänstekvinna,\\nkanhända skall jag få avkomma genom henne.╜  Abram lyssnade till\\nSarais ord;\\noch Sarai, Abrams hustru, tog sin egyptiska tjänstekvinna Hagar\\noch gav henne till hustru åt sin man Abram, sedan denne hade\\nbott tio år i Kanaans land.\\nOch han gick in till Hagar, och hon blev havande.  När hon nu\\nsåg att hon var havande, ringaktade hon sin fru.\\nDå sade Sarai till Abram: ╜Den orätt mig sker komme över dig.\\nJag själv lade min tjänstekvinna i din famn, men då hon nu ser\\natt hon är havande, ringaktar hon mig.  HERREN döme mellan mig\\noch dig.╜\\nAbram sade till Sarai: ╜Din tjänstekvinna är ju i din hand, gör\\nmed henne vad du finner för gott.╜  När då Sarai tuktade henne,\\nflydde hon bort ifrån henne.\\n\\nMen HERRENS ängel kom emot henne vid en vattenkälla i öknen, den\\nkälla som ligger vid vägen till Sur.\\nOch han sade: ╜Hagar, Sarais tjänstekvinna, varifrån kommer du,\\noch vart går du?╜  Hon svarade: ╜Jag är stadd på flykt ifrån min\\nfru Sarai.╜\\nDå sade HERRENS ängel till henne: ╜Vänd tillbaka till din fru,\\noch ödmjuka dig under henne.╜\\nOch HERRENS ängel sade till henne: ╜Jag skall göra din säd\\nmycket talrik, så att man icke skall kunna räkna den för dess\\nmyckenhets skull.╜\\nYtterligare sade HERRENS ängel till henne: ╜Se, du är havande\\noch skall föda en son; honom skall du giva namnet Ismael,\\ndärför att HERREN har hört ditt lidande.\\nOch han skall bliva lik en vildåsna; hans hand skall vara emot\\nvar man, och var mans hand emot honom; och han skall ligga i\\nstrid med alla sina bröder.╜\\nOch hon gav HERREN, som hade talat med henne, ett namn, i det\\nhon sade: ╜Du är Seendets Gud.╜  Hon tänkte nämligen: ╜Har jag\\ndå verkligen här fått se en skymt av <spärr>honom som ser\\nmig</spärr>?╜\\nDärav kallades brunnen Beer-Lahai-Roi; den ligger mellan Kades\\noch Bered.\\n\\nOch Hagar födde åt Abram en son; och Abram gav den son som Hagar\\nhade fött åt honom namnet Ismael.\\nOch Abram var åttiosex år gammal, när Hagar födde Ismael åt\\nAbram.\\n\\nNär Abram var nittionio år gammal, uppenbarade sig HERREN för\\nhonom och sade till honom: ╜Jag är Gud den Allsmäktige.

Kanhända skola tio finnas där.╜  Han svarade: ╜Jag\\nskall då icke fördärva den, för de tios skull.╜\\nOch HERREN gick bort, sedan han hade talat ut med Abraham; och\\nAbraham vände tillbaka hem.\\nOch de två änglarna kommo om aftonen till Sodom, och Lot satt då\\ni Sodoms port.  När Lot fick se dem, stod han upp och gick emot\\ndem och föll ned till jorden på sitt ansikte\\noch sade: ╜I herrar, tagen härbärge i eder tjänares hus och\\nstannen där över natten, och tvån edra fötter; sedan kunnen I i\\nmorgon bittida fortsätta eder färd.╜  De svarade: ╜Nej, vi vilja\\nstanna på gatan över natten.╜\\nMen han bad dem så enträget, att de togo härbärge hos honom och\\nkommo in i hans hus.

Gören allenast icke något mot dessa män,\\neftersom de nu hava gått in under skuggan av mitt tak.╜\\nMen de svarade: ╜Bort med dig!╜  Och de sade ytterligare: ╜Denne,\\nen ensam man, har kommit hit och bor här såsom främling, och han\\nvill dock ständigt upphäva sig som domare.  Men nu skola vi göra\\ndig mer ont än dem.╜  Och de trängde med våld in på mannen Lot\\noch stormade fram för att spränga dörren.\\nDå räckte männen ut sina händer och togo Lot in till sig i huset\\noch stängde dörren.\\nOch de män som stodo utanför husets port slogo de med blindhet,\\nbåde små och stora, så att de förgäves sökte finna porten.\\nOch männen sade till Lot: ╜Har du någon mer här, någon måg,\\neller några söner eller döttrar, eller någon annan som tillhör\\ndig i staden, så för dem bort ifrån detta ställe.\\nTy vi skola fördärva detta ställe; ropet från dem har blivit så\\nstort inför HERREN, att HERREN har utsänt oss till att fördärva\\ndem.╜\\nDå gick Lot ut och talade till sina mågar, som skulle få hans\\ndöttrar, och sade: ╜Stån upp och gån bort ifrån detta ställe; ty\\nHERREN skall fördärva staden.╜  Men hans mågar menade att han\\nskämtade.\\n\\nNär nu morgonrodnaden gick upp, manade änglarna på Lot och sade:\\n╜Stå upp och tag med dig din hustru och dina båda döttrar, som\\ndu har hos dig, på det att du icke må förgås genom stadens\\nmissgärning.╜\\nOch då han ännu dröjde, togo männen honom vid handen jämte hans\\nhustru och hans båda döttrar, ty HERREN ville skona honom; och\\nde förde honom ut, och när de voro utanför staden, släppte de\\nhonom.\\nOch medan de förde dem ut, sade den ene: ╜Fly för ditt livs\\nskull; se dig icke tillbaka, och dröj ingenstädes på Slätten.\\nFly undan till bergen, så att du icke förgås.╜\\nMen Lot sade till dem: ╜Ack nej, Herre.\\nSe, din tjänare har ju funnit nåd för dina ögon, och stor är den\\nbarmhärtighet som du gör med mig, då du vill rädda mitt liv; men\\njag förmår icke fly undan till bergen; jag rädes att olyckan\\nhinner mig, så att jag omkommer.\\nSe, staden därborta ligger helt nära, och det är lätt att fly\\ndit, och den är liten; låt mig fly undan dit -- den är ju så\\nliten -- på det att jag må bliva vid liv.╜\\nDå svarade han honom: ╜Välan, jag skall ock häri göra dig till\\nviljes; jag skall icke omstörta den stad som du talar om.\\nMen skynda att fly undan dit; ty jag kan intet göra, förrän du\\nhar kommit dit.╜  Därav fick staden namnet\\n<spärr>Soar</spärr>.\\n\\nDå nu solen hade gått upp över jorden och Lot hade kommit till\\nSoar,\\nlät HERREN svavel och eld regna från himmelen, från HERREN, över\\nSodom och Gomorra;\\noch han omstörtade dessa städer med hela Slätten och alla dem\\nsom bodde i städerna och det som växte på marken.\\nOch Lots hustru, som följde efter honom, såg sig tillbaka; då\\nblev hon en saltstod.\\nOch när Abraham bittida följande morgon gick till den plats där\\nhan hade stått inför HERREN,\\noch blickade ned över Sodom och Gomorra och över hela\\nSlättlandet, då fick han se en rök stiga upp från landet, lik\\nröken från en smältugn.\\n\\nSå skedde då, att när Gud fördärvade städerna på Slätten, tänkte\\nhan på Abraham och lät Lot komma undan omstörtningen, då han\\nomstörtade städerna där Lot hade bott.\\n\\nOch Lot drog upp från Soar till bergsbygden och bodde där med\\nsina båda döttrar, ty han fruktade för att bo kvar i Soar; och\\nhan bodde med sina båda döttrar i en grotta.\\nDå sade den äldre till den yngre: ╜Vår fader är gammal, och\\ningen man finnes i landet, som kan gå in till oss efter all\\nvärldens sedvänja.\\nKom, låt oss giva vår fader vin att dricka och lägga oss hos\\nhonom, för att vi må skaffa oss livsfrukt genom vår fader.╜\\nSå gåvo de sin fader vin att dricka den natten, och den äldre\\ngick in och lade sig hos sin fader, och han märkte icke när hon\\nlade sig, ej heller när hon stod upp.\\nDagen därefter sade den äldre till den yngre: ╜Se, jag låg i\\nnatt hos min fader; låt oss också denna natt giva honom vin att\\ndricka, och gå du in och lägg dig hos honom, för att vi må skaffa\\noss livsfrukt genom vår fader.╜\\nSå gåvo de också den natten sin fader vin att dricka; och den\\nyngre gick och lade sig hos honom, och han märkte icke när hon\\nlade sig, ej heller när hon stod upp.\\nSå blevo Lots båda döttrar havande genom sin fader.\\nOch den äldre födde en son, och hon gav honom namnet Moab; från\\nhonom härstamma moabiterna ända till denna dag.\\nDen yngre födde ock en son, och hon gav honom namnet Ben-Ammi;\\nfrån honom härstamma Ammons barn ända till denna dag.\\n\\nOch Abraham bröt upp därifrån och drog till Sydlandet; där\\nuppehöll han sig mellan Kades och Sur, och någon tid bodde han i\\nGerar.\\nOch Abraham sade om sin hustru Sara att hon var hans syster.  Då\\nsände Abimelek, konungen i Gerar, och lät hämta Sara till sig.\\nMen Gud kom till Abimelek i en dröm om natten och sade till\\nhonom: ╜Se, du måste dö för den kvinnas skull som du har tagit\\ntill dig, fast hon är en annan mans äkta hustru.╜\\nMen Abimelek hade icke kommit vid henne.  Och han svarade:\\n╜Herre, vill du då dräpa också rättfärdiga människor?\\nSade han icke själv till mig: \\'Hon är min syster\\'?  Och likaså\\nsade hon: \\'Han är min broder.\\'  I mitt hjärtas oskuld och med\\nrena händer har jag gjort detta.╜\\nDå sade Gud till honom i drömmen: ╜Ja, jag vet att du har gjort\\ndetta i ditt hjärtas oskuld, och jag har själv hindrat dig från\\natt synda mot mig; därför har jag icke tillstatt dig att komma\\nvid henne.\\nMen giv nu mannen hans hustru tillbaka; ty han är en profet.\\nOch han må bedja för dig, så att du får leva.  Men om du icke\\ngiver henne tillbaka, så vet att du skall döden dö, du själv och\\nalla som tillhöra dig.\\n\\nDå stod Abimelek upp bittida om morgonen och kallade till sig\\nalla sina tjänare och berättade allt detta för dem; och männen\\nblevo mycket förskräckta.\\nSedan kallade Abimelek Abraham till sig och sade till honom:\\n╜Vad har du gjort mot oss!  Vari har jag försyndat mig mot dig,\\neftersom du har velat komma mig och mitt rike att begå en så\\nstor synd?  På otillbörligt sätt har du handlat mot mig.╜\\nOch Abimelek sade ytterligare till Abraham: ╜Vad var din mening,\\nnär du gjorde detta?╜\\nAbraham svarade: ╜Jag tänkte: \\'På denna ort fruktar man nog icke\\nGud; de skola dräpa mig för min hustrus skull.\\'\\nHon är också verkligen min syster, min faders dotter, fastän\\nicke min moders dotter; och så blev hon min hustru.\\nMen när Gud sände mig ut på vandring bort ifrån min faders hus,\\nsade jag till henne: \\'Bevisa mig din kärlek därmed att du säger\\nom mig, varthelst vi komma, att jag är din broder.\\'╜\\nDå tog Abimelek får och fäkreatur, tjänare och tjänarinnor och\\ngav dem åt Abraham.  Han gav honom ock hans hustru Sara\\ntillbaka.\\nOch Abimelek sade: ╜Se, mitt land ligger öppet för dig; du må bo\\nvar du finner för gott.╜\\nOch till Sara sade han: ╜Se, jag giver åt din broder tusen\\nsiklar silver; det skall för dig vara en försoningsgåva inför\\nallt ditt folk.  Så har du inför alla fått upprättelse.╜\\nOch Abraham bad till Gud, och Gud botade Abimelek och hans hustru\\noch hans tjänstekvinnor, så att de åter kunde föda barn.\\nHERREN hade nämligen gjort alla kvinnor i Abimeleks hus\\nofruktsamma, för Saras, Abrahams hustrus, skull.\\nOch HERREN såg till Sara, såsom han hade lovat, och HERREN\\ngjorde med Sara såsom han hade sagt.\\nSara blev havande och födde åt Abraham en son på hans ålderdom,\\nvid den bestämda tid som Gud hade sagt honom.\\nOch Abraham gav den son som var född åt honom, den som Sara hade\\nfött åt honom, namnet Isak.\\nOch Abraham omskar sin son Isak, när denne var åtta dagar\\ngammal, såsom Gud hade bjudit honom.\\nOch Abraham var hundra år gammal, när hans son Isak föddes åt\\nhonom.\\nOch Sara sade: ╜Gud har berett mig ett löje; var och en som får\\nhöra detta skall le mot mig.╜\\nOch hon sade: ╜Vem skulle hava sagt Abraham att Sara skulle giva\\nbarn di?  Och nu har jag fött honom en son på hans ålderdom!╜\\n\\nOch barnet växte upp och blev avvant; och den dag då Isak\\navvandes gjorde Abraham ett stort gästabud.\\nDå fick Sara se Hagars, den egyptiska kvinnans, son, som denna\\nhade fött åt Abraham, leka och skämta;\\noch hon sade till Abraham: ╜Driv ut denna tjänstekvinna och\\nhennes son, ty denna tjänstekvinnas son skall icke ärva med min\\nson Isak.╜\\nDet talet misshagade Abraham mycket för hans sons skull.\\nMen Gud sade till Abraham: ╜Du må icke för gossens och för din\\ntjänstekvinnas skull låta detta misshaga dig.  Lyssna till Sara\\ni allt vad hon säger dig; ty genom Isak är det som säd skall\\nuppkallas efter dig.\\nMen också tjänstekvinnans son skall jag göra till ett folk,\\ndärför att han är din säd.╜\\n\\nBittida följande morgon tog Abraham bröd och en lägel med vatten\\noch gav det åt Hagar; han lade det på hennes rygg och gav henne\\nbarnet med och lät henne gå.  Och hon begav sig åstad och irrade\\nomkring i Beer-Sebas öken.\\nMen när vattnet i lägeln hade tagit slut, kastade hon barnet\\nifrån sig under en buske\\noch gick bort och satte sig ett stycke därifrån, på ett\\nbågskotts avstånd, ty hon tänkte: ╜Jag förmår icke se på, huru\\nbarnet dör.╜  Och där hon nu satt, på något avstånd, brast hon ut\\ni gråt.\\nDå hörde Gud gossens röst, och Guds ängel ropade till Hagar från\\nhimmelen och sade till henne: ╜Vad fattas dig, Hagar?  Frukta\\nicke; ty Gud har hört gossens röst, där han ligger.\\nGå och lyft upp gossen, och tag honom vid handen; jag skall göra\\nhonom till ett stort folk.╜\\nOch Gud öppnade hennes ögon, så att hon blev varse en\\nvattenbrunn.  Och hon gick dit och fyllde sin lägel med vatten\\noch gav gossen att dricka.\\nOch Gud var med gossen, och han växte upp och bodde i öknen och\\nblev med tiden en bågskytt.\\nHan bodde i öknen Paran; och hans moder tog en hustru åt honom\\nfrån Egyptens land.\\n\\nVid den tiden kom Abimelek med Pikol, sin härhövitsman, och\\ntalade med Abraham och sade: ╜Gud är med dig i allt vad du gör.\\nSå lova mig nu här med ed vid Gud att du icke skall göra dig\\nskyldig till något svek mot mig eller mina barn och\\nefterkommande, utan att du skall bevisa mig och det land där du\\nnu bor såsom främling samma godhet som jag har bevisat dig.╜\\nAbraham sade: ╜Det vill jag lova dig.╜\\nDock gjorde Abraham Abimelek förebråelser angående en\\nvattenbrunn som Abimeleks tjänare hade tagit ifrån honom.\\nMen Abimelek svarade: ╜Jag vet icke vem som har gjort detta;\\nsjälv har du ingenting sagt mig, och jag har icke hört något\\ndärom förrän i dag.╜\\nDå tog Abraham får och fäkreatur och gav åt Abimelek; och de\\nslöto förbund med varandra.\\nMen Abraham ställde sju lamm av hjorden avsides.\\nDå sade Abimelek till Abraham: ╜Vad betyda de sju lammen som du\\nhar ställt där avsides?╜\\nHan svarade: ╜Dessa sju lamm skall du taga emot av mig, för att\\ndetta må vara mig till ett vittnesbörd därom att det är jag som\\nhar grävt denna brunn.╜\\nDärav kallades det stället <spärr>Beer-Seba</spärr>, eftersom\\nde båda där gingo eden.\\nNär de så hade slutit förbund vid Beer-Seba, stodo Abimelek och\\nhans härhövitsman Pikol upp och vände tillbaka till filistéernas\\nland.\\n\\nOch Abraham planterade en tamarisk vid Beer-Seba och åkallade\\ndär HERRENS, den evige Gudens, namn.\\nOch Abraham bodde i filistéernas land en lång tid.\\n\\nEn tid härefter hände sig att Gud satte Abraham på prov.  Han\\nsade till honom: ╜Abraham!╜  Han svarade: ╜Här är jag.╜\\nDå sade han: ╜Tag din son Isak, din ende son, som du har kär,\\noch gå bort till Moria land, och offra honom där såsom\\nbrännoffer, på ett berg som jag skall säga dig.╜\\n\\nBittida följande morgon lastade Abraham sin åsna och tog med sig\\ntvå sina tjänare och sin son Isak; och sedan han hade huggit\\nsönder ved till brännoffer, bröt han upp och begav sig på väg\\ntill den plats som Gud hade sagt honom.\\nNär nu Abraham på tredje dagen lyfte upp sina ögon och fick se\\nplatsen på avstånd,\\nsade han till sina tjänare: ╜Stannen I här med åsnan; jag och\\ngossen vilja gå ditbort.  När vi hava tillbett, skola vi komma\\ntillbaka till eder.╜\\nOch Abraham tog veden till brännoffret och lade den på sin son\\nIsak, men själv tog han elden och kniven, och de gingo så båda\\ntillsammans.\\nDå talade Isak till sin fader Abraham och sade: ╜Min fader!╜\\nHan svarade: ╜Vad vill du, min son?╜  Han sade: ╜Se, här är\\nelden och veden, men var är fåret till brännoffret?╜\\nAbraham svarade: ╜Gud utser nog åt sig fåret till brännoffret,\\nmin son.╜  Så gingo de båda tillsammans.\\n\\nNär de nu hade kommit till den plats som Gud hade sagt Abraham,\\nbyggde han där ett altare och lade veden därpå, sedan band han\\nsin son Isak och lade honom på altaret ovanpå veden.\\nOch Abraham räckte ut sin hand och tog kniven för att slakta sin\\nson.\\nDå ropade HERRENS ängel till honom från himmelen och sade:\\n╜Abraham!  Abraham!╜  Han svarade: ╜Här är jag.╜\\nDå sade han: ╜Låt icke din hand komma vid gossen, och gör honom\\nintet; ty nu vet jag att du fruktar Gud, nu då du icke har\\nundanhållit mig din ende son.╜\\nNär då Abraham lyfte upp sina ögon, fick han bakom sig se en\\nvädur, som hade fastnat med sina horn i ett snår; och Abraham\\ngick dit och tog väduren och offrade den till brännoffer i sin\\nsons ställe.\\nOch Abraham gav den platsen namnet <spärr>HERREN utser</spärr>;\\nnu för tiden heter den <spärr>Berget där HERREN låter se\\nsig</spärr>.\\n\\nOch HERRENS ängel ropade för andra gången till Abraham från\\nhimmelen\\noch sade: ╜Jag svär vid mig själv, säger HERREN: Eftersom du\\nhar gjort detta och icke undanhållit mig din ende son\\ndärför skall jag rikligen välsigna dig och göra din säd talrik\\nsåsom stjärnorna på himmelen och såsom sanden på havets strand;\\noch din säd skall intaga sina fienders portar.\\nOch i din säd skola alla folk på jorden välsigna sig, därför\\natt du lyssnade till mina ord.╜\\nSedan vände Abraham tillbaka till sina tjänare; och de stodo upp\\noch gingo tillsammans till Beer-Seba.  Och Abraham bodde i\\nBeer-Seba.\\n\\nEn tid härefter blev så berättat för Abraham: ╜Se, Milka har ock\\nfött barn åt din broder Nahor.╜\\nBarnen voro Us, hans förstfödde, och Bus, dennes broder, och\\nKemuel, Arams fader,\\nvidare Kesed, Haso, Pildas, Jidlaf och Betuel.\\nMen Betuel födde Rebecka.  Dessa åtta föddes av Milka åt Nahor,\\nAbrahams broder.\\nOch hans bihustru, som hette Reuma, födde ock barn, nämligen\\nTeba, Gaham, Tahas och Maaka.\\n\\nOch Sara blev ett hundra tjugusju år gammal; så gammal blev\\nSara.\\nOch Sara dog i Kirjat-Arba, det är Hebron, i Kanaans land.  Och\\nAbraham kom och höll dödsklagan efter Sara och begrät henne.\\n\\nDärefter stod Abraham upp och gick bort ifrån den döda och\\ntalade så till Hets barn:\\n╜Jag är en främling och gäst hos eder.  Låten mig nu få en egen\\ngrav hos eder, så att jag kan föra min döda dit och begrava\\nhenne.╜\\nDå svarade Hets barn Abraham och sade till honom:\\n╜Hör oss, herre.  Du är en Guds hövding bland oss; begrav din\\ndöda i den förnämligaste av våra gravar.  Ingen av oss skall\\nvägra att giva dig sin grav till att där begrava din döda.╜\\nMen Abraham stod upp och bugade sig för landets folk, Hets barn;\\noch han talade med dem och sade: ╜Om I tillstädjen att jag för\\nut min döda och begraver henne, så hören mig och läggen eder ut\\nför mig hos Efron, Sohars son,\\nså att han giver mig den grotta i Makpela, som tillhör honom,\\noch som ligger vid ändan av hans åker.  Mot full betalning i\\neder krets må han giva mig den till egen grav.╜\\nMen Efron satt där bland Hets barn.  Och Efron, hetiten, svarade\\nAbraham i närvaro av Hets barn, alla som bodde inom hans\\nstadsport; han sade:\\n╜Icke så, min herre.  Hör mig: Jag skänker dig åkern; grottan\\nsom finnes där skänker jag dig ock; jag skänker dig den inför\\nmina landsmäns ögon; begrav där din döda.╜\\nMen Abraham bugade sig för landets folk;\\noch han talade till Efron i närvaro av landets folk och sade:\\n╜Värdes dock höra mig.  Jag vill betala åkerns värde; tag emot\\ndet av mig, och låt mig där begrava min döda.╜\\nDå svarade Efron Abraham och sade till honom:\\n╜Min herre, hör mig.  Ett jordstycke till ett värde av fyra\\nhundra siklar silver, vad betyder det mellan mig och dig?\\nBegrav du din döda.╜\\n\\nOch Abraham förstod Efron och vägde upp åt honom den summa som\\nEfron hade uppgivit i närvaro av Hets barn, fyra hundra siklar\\nsilver, sådant silver som var gångbart i handel.\\nSå skedde det att Efrons åker i Makpela, gent emot Mamre, själva\\nåkern med grottan som fanns där och alla träd på åkern, så\\nlångt dess område sträckte sig runt omkring, blev överlåten åt\\nAbraham till egendom\\ninför Hets barns ögon, inför alla som bodde inom hans stadsport.\\n\\nDärefter begrov Abraham sin hustru Sara i grottan på åkern i\\nMakpela, gent emot Mamre, det är Hebron, i Kanaans land.\\nÅkern med grottan som fanns där blev så av Hets barn överlåten\\nåt Abraham till egen grav.\\nAbraham var nu gammal och kommen till hög ålder, och HERREN hade\\nvälsignat Abraham i alla stycken.\\nDå sade han till sin äldste hustjänare, den som förestod all\\nhans egendom: ╜Lägg din hand under min länd;\\njag vill av dig taga en ed vid HERREN, himmelens Gud och jordens\\nGud, att du icke till hustru åt min son skall taga en dotter\\ntill någon av kananéerna bland vilka jag bor,\\nutan att du skall gå till mitt eget land och till min släkt och\\ndär taga hustru åt min son Isak.╜\\nTjänaren sade till honom: ╜Men om så händer, att kvinnan icke\\nvill följa mig hit till landet, måste jag då föra din son\\ntillbaka till det land som du har kommit ifrån?╜\\nAbraham svarade honom: ╜Tag dig till vara för att föra min son\\ndit tillbaka.\\nHERREN, himmelens Gud, som har fört mig bort ifrån min faders\\nhus och ifrån mitt fädernesland, han som har talat till mig och\\nsvurit och sagt: \\'Åt din säd skall jag giva detta land\\', han\\nskall sända sin ängel framför dig, så att du därifrån skall\\nkunna få en hustru åt min son.\\nMen om kvinnan icke vill följa dig, så är du fri ifrån denna din\\ned till mig.  Allenast må du icke föra min son dit tillbaka.╜\\nDå lade tjänaren sin hand under sin herre Abrahams länd och\\nlovade honom detta med ed.\\n\\nOch tjänaren tog tio av sin herres kameler och drog åstad med\\nallahanda dyrbara gåvor från sin herre; han stod upp och drog\\nåstad till Nahors stad i Aram-Naharaim.\\nDär lät han kamelerna lägra sig utanför staden, vid en\\nvattenbrunn; och det led mot aftonen, den tid då kvinnorna\\nplägade komma ut för att hämta vatten.\\nOch han sade: ╜HERRE, min herre Abrahams Gud, låt mig i dag få\\nett lyckosamt möte, och gör nåd med min herre Abraham.\\nSe, jag står här vid vattenkällan, och stadsbornas döttrar komma\\nhitut för att hämta vatten.\\nOm jag nu säger till en flicka: \\'Håll hit din kruka, och låt mig\\nfå dricka\\' och hon då svarar: \\'Drick; dina kameler vill jag ock\\nvattna\\', må hon då vara den som du har utsett åt din tjänare\\nIsak, så skall jag därav veta att du har gjort nåd med min\\nherre.╜\\n\\nOch se, innan han hade slutat att tala, kom Rebecka ditut, en\\ndotter till Betuel, som var son till Milka, Abrahams broder\\nNahors hustru; och hon bar sin kruka på axeln.\\nOch flickan var mycket fager att skåda, en jungfru som ingen man\\nhade känt.  Hon gick nu ned till källan och fyllde sin kruka och\\nsteg så upp igen.\\nDå skyndade tjänaren emot henne och sade: ╜Låt mig få dricka\\nlitet vatten ur din kruka.╜\\nHon svarade: ╜Drick, min herre╜ och lyfte strax ned krukan på\\nsin hand och gav honom att dricka.\\nOch sedan hon hade givit honom att dricka, sade hon: ╜Jag vill\\nock ösa upp vatten åt dina kameler, till dess att de alla hava\\nfått dricka.╜\\nOch hon tömde strax sin kruka i vattenhon och skyndade åter till\\nbrunnen för att hämta vatten och öste så upp åt alla hans\\nkameler.\\nMen mannen såg på henne under tystnad och undrade om HERREN hade\\ngjort hans resa lyckosam eller icke.\\nOch när alla kamelerna hade druckit, tog mannen fram en näsring\\nav guld, en halv sikel i vikt, och två armband av guld, tio\\nsiklar i vikt,\\noch frågade: ╜Vems dotter är du?  Säg mig det.  Och säg mig om\\nvi kunna få natthärbärge i din faders hus?╜\\nHon svarade honom: ╜Jag är dotter till Betuel, Milkas son, som\\nav henne föddes åt Nahor.╜\\nOch hon sade ytterligare till honom: ╜Vi hava rikligt med både\\nhalm och foder; natthärbärge kan du ock få.╜\\nDå böjde mannen sig ned och tillbad HERREN\\noch sade: ╜Lovad vare HERREN, min herre Abrahams Gud, som icke\\nhar tagit sin nåd och trofasthet ifrån min herre!  Mig har\\nHERREN ledsagat på vägen, hem till min herres fränder.╜\\nOch flickan skyndade åstad och berättade allt detta i sin moders\\nhus.\\n\\nMen Rebecka hade en broder som hette Laban.  Och Laban skyndade\\nåstad till mannen därute vid källan.\\nNär han nämligen såg näsringen och armbanden som hans syster\\nbar, och när han hörde huru hans syster Rebecka berättade: \\'Så\\noch så talade mannen till mig\\', då begav han sig ut till mannen,\\ndär denne stod hos kamelerna vid källan.\\nOch han sade: ╜Kom in, du HERRENS välsignade; varför står du\\nhärute?  Jag har berett plats i huset, och rum finnes för\\nkamelerna.╜\\nSå kom då mannen in i huset; och man lastade av kamelerna, och\\ntog fram halm och foder åt kamelerna, och vatten till att två\\nhans och hans följeslagares fötter.\\nOch man satte fram mat för honom; men han sade: ╜Jag vill icke\\näta, förrän jag har framfört mitt ärende.╜  Laban svarade: ╜Så\\ntala då.╜\\n\\nDå sade han: ╜Jag är Abrahams tjänare.\\nOch HERREN har rikligen välsignat min herre, så att han har\\nblivit en mäktig man; han har givit honom får och fäkreatur,\\nsilver och guld, tjänare och tjänarinnor, kameler och åsnor.\\nOch Sara, min herres hustru, har fött åt min herre en son på sin\\nålderdom, och åt denne har han givit allt vad han äger.\\nOch min herre har tagit en ed av mig och sagt: \\'Till hustru åt\\nmin son skall du icke taga en dotter till någon av kananéerna i\\nvilkas land jag bor,\\nutan du skall gå till min faders hus och till min släkt och där\\ntaga hustru åt min son.\\'\\nDå sade jag till min herre: \\'Men om nu kvinnan icke vill följa\\nmed mig?\\'\\nHan svarade mig: \\'HERREN, inför vilken jag har vandrat, skall\\nsända sin ängel med dig och göra din resa lyckosam, så att du åt\\nmin son får en hustru av min släkt och av min faders hus;\\ni sådant fall skall du vara löst från din ed till mig, när du\\nhar kommit till min släkt.  Också om de icke giva henne åt dig,\\nskall du vara fri ifrån eden till mig.\\'\\nSå kom jag i dag till källan, och jag sade: HERRE, min herre\\nAbrahams Gud, om du vill låta den resa på vilken jag är stadd\\nbliva lyckosam,\\nmå det då ske, när jag nu står här vid vattenkällan, att om en\\nung kvinna kommer ut för att hämta vatten och jag säger till\\nhenne: \\'Låt mig få dricka litet vatten ur din kruka\\'\\noch hon då svarar mig: \\'Drick du; åt dina kameler vill jag ock\\nösa upp vatten\\' -- må hon då vara den kvinna som HERREN har\\nutsett åt min herres son.\\nOch innan jag hade slutat att så tala för mig själv, se, då kom\\nRebecka ut med sin kruka på axeln och gick ned till källan för\\natt hämta vatten.  Då sade jag till henne: \\'Låt mig få dricka.\\'\\nOch strax lyfte hon ned sin kruka från axeln och sade: \\'Drick;\\ndina kameler vill jag ock vattna.\\'  Så drack jag, och hon\\nvattnade också kamelerna.\\nOch jag frågade henne och sade: \\'Vems dotter är du?\\'  Hon\\nsvarade: \\'Jag är dotter till Betuel, Nahors son, som föddes åt\\nhonom av Milka.\\'  Då satte jag ringen i hennes näsa och\\narmbanden på hennes armar.\\nOch jag böjde mig ned och tillbad HERREN och lovade HERREN, min\\nherre Abrahams Gud, som hade ledsagat mig på den rätta vägen, så\\natt jag åt hans son skulle få min herres frändes dotter.\\nOm I nu viljen visa min herre kärlek och trofasthet, så sägen\\nmig det; varom icke, så sägen mig ock det, för att jag då må\\nvända mig åt annat håll, till höger eller till vänster.╜\\n\\nDå svarade Laban och Betuel och sade: ╜Från HERREN har detta\\nutgått; vi kunna i den saken intet säga till dig, varken ont\\neller gott.\\nSe, där står Rebecka inför dig, tag henne och drag åstad; må hon\\nbliva hustru åt din herres son, såsom HERREN har sagt.╜\\nNär Abrahams tjänare hörde deras ord, föll han ned på jorden och\\ntillbad HERREN.\\nSedan tog tjänaren fram smycken av silver och guld, så ock\\nkläder, och gav detta åt Rebecka.  Jämväl åt hennes broder och\\nhennes moder gav han dyrbara skänker.\\nOch de åto och drucko, han och hans följeslagare, och stannade\\nsedan där över natten.  Men om morgonen, när de hade stått upp,\\nsade han: ╜Låten mig nu fara till min herre.╜\\nDå sade hennes broder och hennes moder: ╜Låt flickan stanna hos\\noss några dagar, tio eller så; sedan må du fara.╜\\nMen han svarade dem: ╜Uppehållen mig icke, eftersom HERREN har\\ngjort min resa lyckosam.  Låten mig fara; jag vill resa hem till\\nmin herre.╜\\nDå sade de: ╜Vi vilja kalla hit flickan och fråga henne själv.╜\\nOch de kallade Rebecka till sig och sade till henne: ╜Vill du\\nresa med denne man?╜  Hon svarade: ╜Ja.╜\\nDå bestämde de att deras syster Rebecka jämte sin amma skulle\\nfara med Abrahams tjänare och dennes män.\\nOch de välsignade Rebecka och sade till henne: ╜Av dig, du vår\\nsyster, komme tusen gånger tio tusen, och må dina avkomlingar\\nintaga sina fienders portar.╜\\nOch Rebecka och hennes tärnor stodo upp och satte sig på\\nkamelerna och följde med mannen; så tog tjänaren Rebecka med sig\\noch for sin väg.\\n\\nMen Isak var på väg hem från Beer-Lahai-Roi, ty han bodde i\\nSydlandet.\\nOch mot aftonen hade Isak gått ut på fältet i sorgsna tankar.\\nNär han då lyfte upp sina ögon, fick han se kameler komma.\\nDå nu också Rebecka lyfte upp sina ögon och fick se Isak, steg\\nhon med hast ned från kamelen;\\noch hon frågade tjänaren: ╜Vem är den mannen som kommer emot oss\\ndär på fältet?╜  Tjänaren svarade: ╜Det är min herre.╜  Då tog\\nhon sin slöja och höljde sig i den.\\nOch tjänaren förtäljde för Isak huru han hade uträttat allt.\\nOch Isak förde henne in i sin moder Saras tält; och han tog\\nRebecka till sig, och hon blev hans hustru, och han hade henne\\nkär.  Så blev Isak tröstad i sorgen efter sin moder.\\nOch Abraham tog sig ännu en hustru, och hon hette Ketura.\\nHon födde åt honom Simran, Joksan, Medan, Midjan, Jisbak och\\nSua.\\nOch Joksan födde Saba och Dedan, och Dedans söner voro\\nassuréerna, letuséerna och leumméerna.\\nOch Midjans söner voro Efa, Efer, Hanok, Abida och Eldaa.  Alla\\ndessa voro Keturas söner.\\nOch Abraham gav allt vad han ägde åt Isak.\\nMen åt sönerna till sina bihustrur gav Abraham skänker och\\nskilde dem, medan han själv ännu levde, från sin son Isak och\\nlät dem draga österut, bort till Österlandet.\\n\\nOch detta är antalet av Abrahams levnadsår: ett hundra\\nsjuttiofem år;\\ndärefter gav Abraham upp andan och dog i en god ålder, gammal\\noch mätt på livet, och blev samlad till sina fäder.\\nOch hans söner Isak och Ismael begrovo honom i grottan i\\nMakpela, på hetiten Efrons, Sohars sons, åker gent emot Mamre,\\nden åker som Abraham hade köpt av Hets barn; där blev Abraham\\nbegraven, såväl som hans hustru Sara.\\nOch efter Abrahams död välsignade Gud hans son Isak.  Och Isak\\nbodde vid Beer-Lahai-Roi.\\n\\nOch detta är berättelsen om Ismaels släkt, Abrahams sons, som\\nföddes åt Abraham av Hagar, Saras egyptiska tjänstekvinna.\\nDessa äro namnen på Ismaels söner, med deras namn, efter deras\\nättföljd: Nebajot, Ismaels förstfödde, vidare Kedar, Adbeel,\\nMibsam,\\nMisma, Duma och Massa,\\nHadad och Tema, Jetur, Nafis och Kedma.\\nDessa voro Ismaels söner och dessa deras namn, i deras byar och\\ntältläger, tolv hövdingar efter deras stammar.\\nOch detta är antalet av Ismaels levnadsår: ett hundra trettiosju\\når; därefter gav han upp andan och dog och blev samlad till sina\\nfäder.\\nOch de hade sina boningsplatser från Havila ända till Sur, som\\nligger gent emot Egypten, fram emot Assyrien.  Han kom i strid\\nmed alla sina bröder.\\n\\nOch detta är berättelsen om Isaks, Abrahams sons, släkt.\\nAbraham födde Isak;\\noch Isak var fyrtio år gammal, när han till hustru åt sig tog\\nRebecka, som var dotter till araméen Betuel från Paddan-Aram och\\nsyster till araméen Laban.\\nOch Isak bad till HERREN för sin hustru Rebecka, ty hon var\\nofruktsam; och HERREN bönhörde honom, så att hans hustru Rebecka\\nblev havande.\\nMen barnen stötte varandra i hennes liv; då sade hon: ╜Om det\\nskulle gå så, varför skulle jag då vara till?╜  Och hon gick\\nbort för att fråga HERREN.\\nOch HERREN svarade henne:\\n  ╜Två folk finnas i ditt liv,\\n  två folkstammar skola ur ditt sköte söndras från varandra;\\n  den ena stammen skall vara den andra övermäktig,\\n  och den äldre skall tjäna den yngre.╜\\n\\nNär sedan tiden var inne att hon skulle föda, se, då funnos\\ntvillingar i hennes liv.\\nDen som först kom fram var rödlätt och över hela kroppen såsom\\nen hårmantel; och de gåvo honom namnet Esau.\\nDärefter kom hans broder fram, och denne höll med sin hand i\\nEsaus häl; och han fick namnet Jakob.  Men Isak var sextio\\når gammal, när de föddes.\\n\\nOch barnen växte upp, och Esau blev en skicklig jägare, som höll\\nsig ute på marken; Jakob åter blev en fromsint man, som bodde i\\ntält.\\nOch Isak hade Esau kärast, ty han hade smak för villebråd; men\\nRebecka hade Jakob kärast.\\n\\nEn gång, då Jakob höll på att koka något till soppa, kom Esau\\nhem från marken, uppgiven av hunger.\\nOch Esau sade till Jakob: ╜Låt mig få till livs av det röda, det\\nröda du har där; ty jag är uppgiven av hunger.╜  Därav fick han\\nnamnet <spärr>Edom</spärr>.\\nMen Jakob sade: ╜Sälj då nu åt mig din förstfödslorätt.╜\\nEsau svarade: ╜Jag är ju döden nära; vartill gagnar mig då min\\nförstfödslorätt?╜\\nJakob sade: ╜Så giv mig nu din ed därpå.╜  Och han gav honom sin\\ned och sålde så sin förstfödslorätt till Jakob.\\nMen Jakob gav Esau bröd och linssoppa; och han åt och drack och\\nstod sedan upp och gick sin väg.  Så ringa aktade Esau sin\\nförstfödslorätt.\\n\\nMen en hungersnöd uppstod i landet, en ny hungersnöd, efter den\\nsom hade varit förut, i Abrahams tid.  Då begav sig Isak till\\nAbimelek, filistéernas konung, i Gerar.\\nOch HERREN uppenbarade sig för honom och sade: ╜Drag icke ned\\ntill Egypten; bo kvar i det land som jag skall säga dig.\\nStanna såsom främling här i landet; jag skall vara med dig och\\nvälsigna dig, ty åt dig och din säd skall jag giva alla dessa\\nländer, och skall hålla den ed som jag har svurit din fader\\nAbraham.\\n\\nJag skall göra din säd talrik såsom stjärnorna på himmelen, och\\njag skall giva åt din säd alla dessa länder; och i din säd skola\\nalla folk på jorden välsigna sig,\\ndärför att Abraham har lyssnat till mina ord och hållit vad jag\\nhar bjudit honom hålla, mina bud, mina stadgar och mina lagar.╜\\nSå stannade Isak kvar i Gerar.\\n\\nOch när männen på orten frågade honom om hans hustru, sade han:\\n╜Hon är min syster.╜  Han fruktade nämligen för att säga att hon\\nvar hans hustru, ty han tänkte: ╜Männen här på orten kunde då\\ndräpa mig för Rebeckas skull, eftersom hon är så fager att\\nskåda.╜\\nMen när han hade varit där en längre tid, hände sig en gång, då\\nAbimelek, filistéernas konung, blickade ut genom fönstret, att\\nhan fick se Isak kärligt skämta med sin hustru Rebecka.\\nDå kallade Abimelek Isak till sig och sade: ╜Hon är ju din\\nhustru; huru har du då kunnat säga: \\'Hon är min syster\\'?╜  Isak\\nsvarade honom: ╜Jag fruktade att jag annars skulle bliva dödad\\nför hennes skull.╜\\nDå sade Abimelek: ╜Vad har du gjort mot oss!  Huru lätt kunde\\ndet icke hava skett att någon av folket hade lägrat din hustru?\\nOch så hade du dragit skuld över oss.╜\\nSedan bjöd Abimelek allt folket och sade: ╜Den som kommer vid\\ndenne man eller vid hans hustru, han skall straffas med döden.╜\\n\\nOch Isak sådde där i landet och fick det året hundrafalt, ty\\nHERREN välsignade honom.\\nOch han blev en mäktig man; hans makt blev större och större, så\\natt han till slut var mycket mäktig.\\nHan ägde så många får och fäkreatur och så många tjänare, att\\nfilistéerna begynte avundas honom.\\nOch alla de brunnar som hans faders tjänare hade grävt i hans\\nfader Abrahams tid, dem hade filistéerna kastat igen och fyllt\\nmed grus.\\nOch Abimelek sade till Isak: ╜Drag bort ifrån oss; ty du har\\nblivit oss alltför mäktig.╜\\nDå drog Isak bort därifrån och slog upp sitt läger i Gerars dal\\noch bodde där.\\nOch Isak lät åter gräva ut de vattenbrunnar som hade blivit\\ngrävda i hans fader Abrahams tid, men som filistéerna efter\\nAbrahams död hade kastat igen; och han gav dem åter de namn som\\nhans fader hade givit dem.\\nOch Isaks tjänare grävde i dalen och funno där en brunn med\\nrinnande vatten.\\nMen herdarna i Gerar begynte tvista med Isaks herdar och sade:\\n╜Vattnet är vårt.╜  Då gav han den brunnen namnet\\n<spärr>Esek</spärr>, eftersom de hade kivat med honom.\\nDärefter grävde de en annan brunn, men om den kommo de ock i\\ntvist; då gav han den namnet <spärr>Sitna</spärr>.\\nSedan begav han sig därifrån till en annan plats och grävde åter\\nen brunn; om den tvistade de icke.  Därför gav han denna namnet\\n<spärr>Rehobot</spärr>, i det han sade: ╜Nu har ju HERREN\\ngivit oss utrymme, så att vi kunna föröka oss i landet.╜\\n\\nSedan drog han därifrån upp till Beer-Seba.\\nOch HERREN uppenbarade sig för honom den natten och sade: ╜Jag\\när Abrahams, din faders, Gud.  Frukta icke, ty jag är med dig,\\noch jag skall välsigna dig och göra din säd talrik, för min\\ntjänare Abrahams skull.╜\\nDå byggde han där ett altare och åkallade HERRENS namn och slog\\ndär upp sitt tält.  Och Isaks tjänare grävde där en brunn.\\n\\nOch Abimelek begav sig till honom från Gerar med Ahussat, sin\\nvän, och Pikol, sin härhövitsman.\\nMen Isak sade till dem: ╜Varför kommen I till mig, I som haten\\nmig och haven drivit mig ifrån eder?╜\\nDe svarade: ╜Vi hava tydligt sett att HERREN är med dig; därför\\ntänkte vi: \\'Låt oss giva varandra en ed, vi och du, så att vi\\nsluta ett förbund med dig,\\natt du icke skall göra oss något ont, likasom vi å vår sida\\nicke hava kommit vid dig, och likasom vi icke hava gjort dig\\nannat än gott och hava låtit dig fara i frid.\\'  Du är nu HERRENS\\nvälsignade.╜\\nDå gjorde han ett gästabud för dem, och de åto och drucko.\\nBittida följande morgon svuro de varandra eden; sedan lät Isak\\ndem gå, och de foro ifrån honom i frid.\\nSamma dag kommo Isaks tjänare och berättade för honom om den\\nbrunn som de hade grävt och sade till honom: ╜Vi hava funnit\\nvatten.╜\\nOch han kallade den Sibea.  Därav heter staden Beer-Seba ännu i\\ndag.\\n\\nNär Esau var fyrtio år gammal, tog han till hustrur Judit,\\ndotter till hetiten Beeri, och Basemat, dotter till hetiten\\nElon.\\nMen dessa blevo en hjärtesorg för Isak och Rebecka.\\n\\nNär Isak hade blivit gammal och hans ögon voro skumma, så att\\nhan icke kunde se, kallade han till sig Esau, sin äldste son,\\noch sade till honom: ╜Min son!╜  Han svarade honom: ╜Vad vill\\ndu?╜\\nDå sade han: ╜Se, jag är gammal och vet icke när jag skall dö.\\nSå tag nu dina jaktredskap, ditt koger och din båge, och gå ut i\\nmarken och jaga villebråd åt mig;\\nred sedan till åt mig en smaklig rätt, en sådan som jag tycker\\nom, och bär in den till mig till att äta, på det att min själ må\\nvälsigna dig, förrän jag dör.╜\\n\\nMen Rebecka hörde huru Isak talade till sin son Esau.  Och medan\\nEsau gick ut i marken för att jaga villebråd till att föra hem,\\nsade Rebecka till sin son Jakob: ╜Se, jag har hört din fader\\ntala så till din broder Esau:\\n\\'Hämta mig villebråd och red till åt mig en smaklig rätt, på det\\natt jag må äta och sedan välsigna dig inför HERREN, förrän jag\\ndör.\\'\\nSå hör nu vad jag säger, min son, och gör vad jag bjuder dig.\\nGå bort till hjorden och hämta mig därifrån två goda killingar,\\nså vill jag av dem tillreda en smaklig rätt åt din fader, en\\nsådan som han tycker om.\\nOch du skall bära in den till din fader till att äta, på det att\\nhan må välsigna dig, förrän han dör.╜\\nMen Jakob sade till sin moder Rebecka: ╜Min broder Esau är ju\\nluden, och jag är slät.\\nKanhända tager min fader på mig, och jag bliver då av honom\\nhållen för en bespottare och skaffar mig förbannelse i stället\\nför välsignelse.╜\\nDå sade hans moder till honom: ╜Den förbannelsen komme över mig,\\nmin son; hör nu allenast vad jag säger, och gå och hämta dem åt\\nmig.╜\\n\\nDå gick han och hämtade dem och bar dem till sin moder; och hans\\nmoder tillredde en smaklig rätt, en sådan som hans fader tyckte\\nom.\\nOch Rebecka tog Esaus, sin äldre sons, högtidskläder, som hon\\nhade hos sig i huset, och satte dem på Jakob, sin yngre son.\\nOch med skinnen av killingarna beklädde hon hans händer och den\\nsläta delen av hans hals.\\nSedan lämnade hon åt sin son Jakob den smakliga rätten och\\nbrödet som hon hade tillrett.\\nOch han gick in till sin fader och sade: ╜Min fader!╜  Han\\nsvarade: ╜Vad vill du?  Vem är du, min son?╜\\nDå sade Jakob till sin fader: ╜Jag är Esau, din förstfödde.  Jag\\nhar gjort såsom du tillsade mig; sätt dig upp och ät av mitt\\nvillebråd, på det att din själ må välsigna mig.╜\\nMen Isak sade till sin son: ╜Huru har du så snart kunnat finna\\nnågot, min son?╜  Han svarade: ╜HERREN, din Gud, skickade det i\\nmin väg.╜\\nDå sade Isak till Jakob: ╜Kom hit, min son, och låt mig taga på\\ndig och känna om du är min son Esau eller icke.╜\\nOch Jakob gick fram till sin fader Isak; och när denne hade\\ntagit på honom, sade han: ╜Rösten är Jakobs röst, men händerna\\näro Esaus händer.╜\\nOch han kände icke igen honom, ty hans händer voro ludna såsom\\nhans broder Esaus händer; och han välsignade honom.\\nMen han frågade: ╜Är du verkligen min son Esau?╜  Han svarade:\\n╜Ja.╜\\nDå sade han: ╜Bär hit maten åt mig och låt mig äta av min sons\\nvillebråd, på det att min själ må välsigna dig.╜  Och han bar\\nfram den till honom, och han åt; och han räckte honom vin, och\\nhan drack.\\nDärefter sade hans fader Isak till honom: ╜Kom hit och kyss mig,\\nmin son.╜\\nNär han då gick fram och kysste honom, kände han lukten av hans\\nkläder och välsignade honom; han sade:\\n  ╜Se, av min son utgår doft,\\n  lik doften av en mark,\\n      som HERREN har välsignat.\\nSå give dig Gud\\n      av himmelens dagg\\n  och av jordens fetma\\n  och säd och vin i rikligt mått.\\nFolk tjäne dig,\\n  och folkslag falle ned för dig.\\n  Bliv en herre över dina bröder,\\n  och må din moders söner falla ned för dig.\\n  Förbannad vare den som förbannar dig,\\n  och välsignad vare den som välsignar dig!╜\\n\\nMen när Isak hade givit Jakob sin välsignelse och Jakob just\\nhade gått ut från sin fader Isak, kom hans broder Esau hem från\\njakten.\\nDärefter tillredde också han en smaklig rätt och bar in den till\\nsin fader och sade till sin fader: ╜Må min fader stå upp och äta\\nav sin sons villebråd, på det att din själ må välsigna mig.╜\\nHans fader Isak frågade honom: ╜Vem är du?╜  Han svarade: ╜Jag\\när Esau, din förstfödde son.╜\\nDå blev Isak övermåttan häpen och sade: ╜Vem var då den jägaren\\nsom bar in till mig sitt villebråd, så att jag åt av allt, förrän\\ndu kom, och sedan välsignade honom?  Välsignad skall han ock\\nförbliva.╜\\nNär Esau hörde sin faders ord, brast han ut i högljudd och\\nbitter klagan och sade till sin fader: ╜Välsigna också mig, min\\nfader.╜\\nMen han svarade: ╜Din broder har kommit med svek och tagit din\\nvälsignelse.╜\\nDå sade han: ╜Han heter ju Jakob, och han har nu också två\\ngånger bedragit mig.  Min förstfödslorätt har han tagit, och se,\\nnu har han ock tagit min välsignelse.╜  Och han frågade: ╜Har du\\ndå ingen välsignelse kvar för mig?╜\\nIsak svarade och sade till Esau: ╜Se, jag har satt honom till en\\nherre över dig, och alla hans bröder har jag givit honom till\\ntjänare, och med säd och vin har jag begåvat honom; vad skall\\njag då nu göra för dig, min son?╜\\nEsau sade till sin fader: ╜Har du då allenast den enda\\nvälsignelsen, min fader?  Välsigna också mig, min fader.╜  Och\\nEsau brast ut i gråt.\\nDå svarade hans fader Isak och sade till honom:\\n  ╜Se, fjärran ifrån jordens fetma\\n      skall din boning vara\\n  och utan dagg från himmelen ovanefter.\\nAv ditt svärd skall du leva,\\n  och du skall tjäna din broder.\\n  Men det skall ske, när du samlar din kraft,\\n  att du river hans ok från din hals.╜\\n\\nOch Esau blev hätsk mot Jakob för den välsignelses skull som\\nhans fader hade givit honom.  Och Esau sade vid sig själv:\\n╜Snart skola de dagar komma, då vi få sörja vår fader; då skall\\njag dräpa min broder Jakob.╜\\nNär man nu berättade för Rebecka vad hennes äldre son Esau hade\\nsagt, sände hon och lät kalla till sig sin yngre son Jakob och\\nsade till honom: ╜Se, din broder Esau vill hämnas på dig och\\ndräpa dig.\\nSå hör nu vad jag säger, min son: stå upp och fly till min\\nbroder Laban i Haran,\\noch stanna någon tid hos honom, till dess din broders\\nförbittring har upphört,\\nja, till dess din broders vrede mot dig har upphört och han\\nförgäter vad du har gjort mot honom.  Då skall jag sända åstad\\noch hämta dig därifrån.  Varför skall jag mista eder båda på\\nsamma gång?╜\\n\\nOch Rebecka sade till Isak: ╜Jag är led vid livet för Hets\\ndöttrars skull.  Om Jakob tager hustru bland Hets döttrar, en\\nsådan som dessa, någon bland landets döttrar, varför skulle jag\\ndå leva?╜\\n\\nDå kallade Isak till sig Jakob och välsignade honom; och han\\nbjöd honom och sade till honom: ╜Tag dig icke till hustru någon\\nav Kanaans döttrar,\\nutan stå upp och begiv dig till Paddan-Aram, till Betuels, din\\nmorfaders, hus, och tag dig en hustru därifrån, någon av Labans,\\ndin morbroders, döttrar.\\nOch må Gud den Allsmäktige välsigna dig och göra dig fruktsam\\noch föröka dig, så att skaror av folk komma av dig;\\nmå han giva åt dig Abrahams välsignelse, åt dig och din säd med\\ndig, så att du får taga i besittning det land som Gud har givit\\nåt Abraham, och där du nu bor såsom främling.╜\\nSå sände Isak åstad Jakob, och denne begav sig till Paddan-Aram,\\ntill araméen Laban, Betuels son, som var broder till Rebecka,\\nJakobs och Esaus moder.\\n\\nNär nu Esau såg att Isak hade välsignat Jakob och sänt honom\\ntill Paddan-Aram för att därifrån taga sig hustru -- ty han hade\\nvälsignat honom och bjudit honom och sagt: ╜Du skall icke taga\\ntill hustru någon av Kanaans döttrar╜ --\\noch när han såg att Jakob hade lytt sin fader och moder och\\nbegivit sig till Paddan-Aram,\\ndå märkte Esau att Kanaans döttrar misshagade hans fader Isak;\\noch Esau gick bort till Ismael och tog Mahalat, Abrahams son\\nIsmaels dotter, Nebajots syster, till hustru åt sig, utöver de\\nhustrur han förut hade.\\n\\nMen Jakob begav sig från Beer-Seba på väg till Haran.\\nOch han kom då till den heliga platsen och stannade där över\\nnatten, ty solen hade gått ned; och han tog en av stenarna på\\nplatsen för att hava den till huvudgärd och lade sig att sova\\ndär.\\nDå hade han en dröm.  Han såg en stege vara rest på jorden, och\\ndess övre ände räckte upp till himmelen, och Guds änglar stego\\nupp och ned på den.\\nOch se, HERREN stod framför honom och sade: ╜Jag är HERREN,\\nAbrahams, din faders, Gud och Isaks Gud.  Det land där du ligger\\nskall jag giva åt dig och din säd.\\nOch din säd skall bliva såsom stoftet på jorden, och du skall\\nutbreda dig åt väster och öster och norr och söder, och alla\\nsläkter på jorden skola varda välsignade i dig och i din säd.\\nOch se, jag är med dig och skall bevara dig, varthelst du går,\\noch jag skall föra dig tillbaka till detta land; ty jag skall\\nicke övergiva dig, till dess jag har gjort vad jag har lovat\\ndig.╜\\n\\nNär Jakob vaknade upp ur sömnen sade han: ╜HERREN är sannerligen\\npå denna plats, och jag visste det icke!╜\\nOch han betogs av fruktan och sade: ╜Detta måste vara en helig\\nplats, här bor förvisso Gud, och här är himmelens port.╜\\nOch bittida om morgonen stod Jakob upp och tog stenen som han\\nhade haft till huvudgärd och reste den till en stod och göt olja\\ndärovanpå.\\nOch han gav den platsen namnet Betel; förut hade staden hetat\\nLus.\\nOch Jakob gjorde ett löfte och sade: ╜Om Gud är med mig och\\nbevarar mig under den resa som jag nu är stadd på och giver mig\\nbröd till att äta och kläder till att kläda mig med,\\nså att jag kommer i frid tillbaka till min faders hus, då skall\\nHERREN vara min Gud;\\noch denna sten som jag har rest till en stod skall bliva ett\\nGuds hus, och av allt vad du giver mig skall jag giva dig\\ntionde.╜\\n\\nOch Jakob begav sig åstad på väg till Österlandet.\\nDär fick han se en brunn på fältet, och vid den lågo tre\\nfårhjordar, ty ur denna brunn plägade man vattna hjordarna.  Och\\nstenen som låg över brunnens öppning var stor;\\ndärför plägade man låta alla hjordarna samlas dit och vältrade\\nså stenen från brunnens öppning och vattnade fåren; sedan lade\\nman stenen tillbaka på sin plats över brunnens öppning.\\nOch Jakob sade till männen: ╜Mina bröder, varifrån ären I?╜  De\\nsvarade: ╜Vi äro från Haran.╜\\nDå sade han till dem: ╜Kännen I Laban, Nahors son?╜  De svarade:\\n╜Ja.╜\\nHan frågade dem vidare: ╜Står det väl till med honom?╜  De\\nsvarade: ╜Ja; och se, där kommer hans dotter Rakel med fåren.╜\\nHan sade: ╜Det är ju ännu full dag; ännu är det icke tid att\\nsamla boskapen.  Vattnen fåren, och fören dem åter i bet.╜\\nMen de svarade: ╜Vi kunna icke göra det, förrän alla hjordarna\\nhava blivit samlade och man har vältrat stenen från brunnens\\nöppning; då vattna vi fåren.╜\\nMedan han ännu talade med dem, hade Rakel kommit dit med sin\\nfaders får; ty hon plägade vakta dem.\\nNär Jakob fick se sin morbroder Labans dotter Rakel komma med\\nLabans, hans morbroders, får, gick han fram och vältrade stenen\\nfrån brunnens öppning och vattnade sin morbroder Labans får.\\nOch Jakob kysste Rakel och brast ut i gråt.\\nOch Jakob omtalade för Rakel att han var hennes faders frände,\\noch att han var Rebeckas son; och hon skyndade åstad och\\nomtalade det för sin fader.\\nDå nu Laban fick höras talas om sin systerson Jakob, skyndade\\nhan emot honom och tog honom i famn och kysste honom och förde\\nhonom in i sitt hus; och han förtäljde för Laban allt som hade\\nhänt honom.\\nOch Laban sade till honom: ╜Ja, du är mitt kött och ben.╜  Och\\nhan stannade hos honom en månads tid.\\n\\nOch Laban sade till Jakob: ╜Du är ju min frände.  Skulle du då\\ntjäna mig för intet?  Säg mig vad du vill hava i lön?╜\\nNu hade Laban två döttrar; den äldre hette Lea, och den yngre\\nhette Rakel.\\nOch Leas ögon voro matta, men Rakel hade en skön gestalt och var\\nskön att skåda.\\nOch Jakob hade fattat kärlek till Rakel; därför sade han: ╜Jag\\nvill tjäna dig i sju år för Rakel, din yngre dotter.╜\\nLaban svarade: ╜Det är bättre att jag giver henne åt dig, än att\\njag skulle giva henne åt någon annan; bliv kvar hos mig.╜\\nSå tjänade Jakob för Rakel i sju år, och det tycktes honom vara\\nallenast några dagar; så kär hade han henne.\\n\\nDärefter sade Jakob till Laban: ╜Giv mig min hustru, ty min tid\\när nu förlupen; låt mig gå in till henne.╜\\nDå bjöd Laban tillhopa allt folket på orten och gjorde ett\\ngästabud.\\nMen när aftonen kom, tog han sin dotter Lea och förde henne till\\nhonom, och han gick in till henne.\\nOch Laban gav sin tjänstekvinna Silpa åt sin dotter Lea till\\ntjänstekvinna.\\n\\nOm morgonen fick Jakob se att det var Lea.  Då sade han till\\nLaban: ╜Vad har du gjort mot mig?  Var det icke för Rakel jag\\ntjänade hos dig?  Varför har du så bedragit mig?╜\\nLaban svarade: ╜Det är icke sed på vår ort att man giver bort\\nden yngre före den äldre.\\nLåt nu dennas bröllopsvecka gå till ända, så vilja vi giva dig\\nockså den andra, mot det att du gör tjänst hos mig i ännu\\nytterligare sju år.╜\\nOch Jakob samtyckte härtill och lät hennes bröllopsvecka gå till\\nända.  Sedan gav han honom sin dotter Rakel till hustru.\\nOch Laban gav sin tjänstekvinna Bilha åt sin dotter Rakel till\\ntjänstekvinna.\\nSå gick han in också till Rakel, och han hade Rakel kärare än\\nLea.  Sedan tjänade han hos honom i ännu ytterligare sju år.\\n\\nMen då HERREN såg att Lea var försmådd, gjorde han henne\\nfruktsam, medan Rakel var ofruktsam.\\nOch Lea blev havande och födde en son, och hon gav honom namnet\\nRuben, ty hon tänkte: ╜HERREN <spärr>har sett till mitt\\nlidande</spärr>; ja, nu skall min man hava mig kär.╜\\nOch hon blev åter havande och födde en son.  Då sade hon:\\n╜HERREN <spärr>har hört</spärr> att jag har varit försmådd,\\ndärför har han givit mig också denne.╜  Och hon gav honom namnet\\nSimeon.\\nOch åter blev hon havande och födde en son.  Då sade hon: ╜Nu\\nskall väl ändå min man <spärr>hålla sig till</spärr> mig; jag\\nhar ju fött honom tre söner.╜  Därav fick denne namnet Levi.\\nÅter blev hon havande och födde en son.  Då sade hon: ╜Nu vill\\njag <spärr>tacka</spärr> HERREN.╜  Därför gav hon honom\\nnamnet Juda.  Sedan upphörde hon att föda.\\n\\nDå nu Rakel såg att hon icke födde barn åt Jakob, avundades hon\\nsin syster och sade till Jakob: ╜Skaffa mig barn, eljest dör\\njag.╜\\nDå upptändes Jakobs vrede mot Rakel, och han svarade: ╜Håller du\\ndå mig för Gud?  Det är ju han som förmenar dig livsfrukt.╜\\nHon sade: ╜Se, där är min tjänarinna Bilha; gå in till henne,\\nför att hon må föda barn i mitt sköte, så att genom henne också\\njag får avkomma.╜\\nSå gav hon honom sin tjänstekvinna Bilha till hustru, och Jakob\\ngick in till henne.\\nOch Bilha blev havande och födde åt Jakob en son.\\nDå sade Rakel: ╜<spärr>Gud har skaffat rätt</spärr> åt mig;\\nhan har hört min röst och givit mig en son.╜  Därför gav hon\\nhonom namnet Dan.\\nÅter blev Bilha, Rakels tjänstekvinna, havande, och hon födde åt\\nJakob en andre son.\\nDå sade Rakel: ╜<spärr>Strider</spärr> om Gud har jag stritt\\nmed min syster och har vunnit seger.╜  Och hon gav honom namnet\\nNaftali.\\n\\nDå Lea nu såg att hon hade upphört att föda, tog hon sin\\ntjänstekvinna Silpa och gav henne åt Jakob till hustru.\\nOch Silpa, Leas tjänstekvinna, födde åt Jakob en son.\\nDå sade Lea: ╜Till <spärr>lycka</spärr>!╜  Och hon gav honom\\nnamnet Gad.\\nOch Silpa, Leas tjänstekvinna, födde åt Jakob en andre son.\\nDå sade Lea: ╜Till <spärr>sällhet</spärr> för mig!  Ja,\\njungfrur skola prisa mig säll.╜  Och hon gav honom namnet Aser.\\n\\nMen Ruben gick ut en gång vid tiden för veteskörden och fann då\\nkärleksäpplen på marken och bar dem till sin moder Lea.  Då sade\\nRakel till Lea: ╜Giv mig några av din sons kärleksäpplen.╜\\nMen hon svarade henne: ╜Är det icke nog att du har tagit min\\nman?  Vill du ock taga min sons kärleksäpplen?╜  Rakel sade: ╜Må\\nhan då i natt ligga hos dig, om jag får din sons kärleksäpplen.╜\\nNär nu Jakob om aftonen kom hem från marken, gick Lea honom till\\nmötes och sade: ╜Till mig skall du gå in; ty jag har givit min\\nsons kärleksäpplen såsom lön för dig.╜  Så låg han hos henne den\\nnatten.\\nOch Gud hörde Lea, så att hon blev havande, och hon födde åt\\nJakob en femte son.\\nDå sade Lea: ╜Gud har givit mig min <spärr>lön</spärr>, för\\ndet att jag gav min tjänstekvinna åt min man.╜  Och hon gav honom\\nnamnet Isaskar.\\nÅter blev Lea havande, och hon födde åt Jakob en sjätte son.\\nDå sade Lea: ╜Gud har givit mig en god <spärr>gåva</spärr>.\\nNu skall min man <spärr>förbliva boende</spärr> hos mig, ty\\njag har fött honom sex söner.╜  Och hon gav honom namnet Sebulon.\\nDärefter födde hon en dotter och gav henne namnet Dina.\\n\\nMen Gud tänkte på Rakel; Gud hörde henne och gjorde henne\\nfruktsam.\\nHon blev havande och födde en son.  Då sade hon: ╜Gud <spärr>har\\ntagit bort</spärr> min smälek.╜\\nOch hon gav honom namnet Josef, i det hon sade: ╜HERREN\\n<spärr>give</spärr> mig <spärr>ännu</spärr> en son.╜\\n\\nDå nu Rakel hade fött Josef, sade Jakob till Laban: ╜Låt mig\\nfara; jag vill draga hem till min ort och till mitt land.\\nGiv mig mina hustrur och mina barn, som jag har tjänat dig för,\\noch låt mig draga hem; du vet ju själv huru jag har tjänat dig.╜\\nLaban svarade honom: ╜Låt mig finna nåd för dina ögon; jag vet\\ngenom hemliga tecken att HERREN för din skull har välsignat\\nmig.╜\\nOch han sade ytterligare: ╜Bestäm vad du vill hava i lön av mig,\\nså skall jag giva dig det.╜\\nHan svarade honom: ╜Du vet själv huru jag har tjänat dig, och\\nvad det har blivit av din boskap under min vård.\\nTy helt litet var det som du hade, förrän jag kom, men det har\\nförökat sig och blivit mycket, ty HERREN har välsignat dig,\\nvarhelst jag har gått fram.  Men när skall jag nu också få göra\\nnågot för mitt eget hus?╜\\nHan svarade: ╜Vad skall jag giva dig?╜  Och Jakob sade: ╜Du\\nskall icke alls giva mig något.  Om du vill göra mot mig såsom\\njag nu säger, så skall jag fortfara att vara herde för din hjord\\noch vakta den.\\nJag vill i dag gå igenom hela din hjord och avskilja ur den alla\\nspräckliga och brokiga såväl som alla svarta djur bland fåren,\\nså ock vad som är brokigt och spräckligt bland getterna; sådant\\nmå sedan bliva min lön.\\nOch när du framdeles kommer för att med egna ögon se vad som har\\nblivit min lön, då skall min rättfärdighet vara mitt vittne;\\nalla getter hos mig, som icke äro spräckliga eller brokiga, och\\nalla får hos mig, som icke äro svarta, de skola räknas såsom\\nstulna.╜\\nDå sade Laban: ╜Välan, blive det såsom du har sagt.╜\\nOch samma dag avskilde han de strimmiga och brokiga bockarna och\\nalla spräckliga och brokiga getter -- alla djur som något vitt\\nfanns på -- och alla svarta djur bland fåren; och detta lämnade\\nhan i sina söners vård.\\nOch han lät ett avstånd av tre dagsresor vara mellan sig och\\nJakob.  Och Jakob fick Labans övriga hjord att vakta.\\n\\nMen Jakob tog sig friska käppar av poppel, mandelträd och lönn\\noch skalade på dem vita ränder, i det han blottade det vita på\\nkäpparna.\\nSedan lade han käpparna, som han hade skalat, i rännorna eller\\nvattenhoarna dit hjordarna kommo för att dricka, så att djuren\\nhade dem framför sig; och de hade just sin parningstid, när de\\nnu kommo för att dricka.\\nOch djuren parade sig vid käpparna, och så blev djurens avföda\\nstrimmig, spräcklig och brokig.\\nDärefter avskilde Jakob lammen och ordnade djuren så, att de\\nvände huvudena mot det som var strimmigt och mot allt som var\\nsvart i Labans hjord; så skaffade han sig egna hjordar, som han\\nicke lät komma ihop med Labans hjord.\\nOch så ofta de kraftigare djuren skulle para sig, lade Jakob\\nkäpparna framför djurens ögon i rännorna, så att de parade sig\\nvid käpparna.\\nMen när det var de svagare djuren, lade han icke dit dem.\\nHärigenom tillföllo de svaga Laban och de kraftiga Jakob.\\nSå blev mannen övermåttan rik; han fick mycken småboskap,\\ndärtill ock tjänarinnor och tjänare, kameler och åsnor.\\n\\nMen han fick höra huru Labans söner talade så: ╜Jakob har tagit\\nallt vad vår fader ägde; av det vår fader ägde är det som han\\nhar skaffat sig all denna rikedom.╜\\nJakob märkte också att Laban icke såg på honom med samma ögon\\nsom förut.\\nOch HERREN sade till Jakob: ╜Vänd tillbaka till dina fäders land\\noch till din släkt; jag skall vara med dig.╜\\nDå sände Jakob och lät kalla Rakel och Lea ut på marken till sin\\nhjord;\\noch han sade till dem: ╜Jag märker att eder fader icke ser på\\nmig med samma ögon som förut, nu då min faders Gud har varit med\\nmig.\\nOch I veten själva att jag har tjänat eder fader av alla mina\\nkrafter;\\nmen eder fader har handlat svikligt mot mig och tio gånger\\nförändrat min lön.  Dock har Gud icke tillstatt honom att göra\\nmig något ont.\\nNär han sade: \\'De spräckliga skola vara din lön\\', då fick hela\\nhjorden spräcklig avföda; och när han sade: \\'De strimmiga skola\\nvara din lön\\', då fick hela jorden strimmig avföda.\\nSå tog Gud eder faders boskap och gav den åt mig.\\nTy när parningstiden kom, lyfte jag upp mina ögon och fick se i\\ndrömmen att hannarna som betäckte småboskapen voro strimmiga,\\nspräckliga och fläckiga.\\nOch Guds ängel sade till mig i drömmen: \\'Jakob!\\'  Jag svarade:\\n\\'Här är jag.\\'\\nDå sade han: \\'Lyft upp dina ögon och se huru alla hannar som\\nbetäcka småboskapen äro strimmiga, spräckliga och fläckiga.  Jag\\nhar ju sett allt vad Laban gör mot dig.\\nJag är den Gud som du såg i Betel, där du smorde en stod, och\\ndär du gjorde mig ett löfte.  Stå nu upp och drag ut ur detta\\nland, och vänd tillbaka till ditt fädernesland.\\'╜\\nDå svarade Rakel och Lea och sade till honom: ╜Hava vi numera\\nnågon lott eller arvedel i vår faders hus?\\nBlevo vi icke av honom aktade såsom främlingar, när han sålde\\noss?  Sedan har han ju ock förtärt vad han fick i betalning för\\noss.\\nJa, all den rikedom som Gud har avhänt vår fader tillhör oss och\\nvåra barn.  Så gör nu allt vad Gud har sagt dig.╜\\nDå stod Jakob upp och satte sina barn och sina hustrur på\\nkamelerna\\noch förde bort med sig all boskap och alla ägodelar som han hade\\nförvärvat, den boskap han ägde, och som han hade förvärvat i\\nPaddan-Aram, och begav sig på väg till sin fader Isak i Kanaans\\nland.\\nMen Laban hade gått bort för att klippa sina får; då stal Rakel\\nsin faders husgudar,\\noch Jakob stal sig undan från araméen Laban, så att han icke lät\\ndenne märka att han ämnade fly.\\nSå flydde han med allt sitt; han bröt upp och gick över floden\\noch ställde sin färd mot Gileads berg.\\n\\nMen på tredje dagen fick Laban veta att Jakob hade flytt.\\nDå tog han med sig sina fränder och satte efter honom sju\\ndagsresor och hann upp honom på Gileads berg.\\nMen Gud kom till araméen Laban i en dröm om natten och sade\\ntill honom: ╜Tag dig till vara för att tala något mot Jakob, vad\\ndet vara må.╜\\nOch Laban hann upp Jakob.  Denne hade då slagit upp sitt tält på\\nberget, och Laban med sina fränder hade ock sitt tält uppslaget\\npå Gileads berg.\\nDå sade Laban till Jakob: ╜Vad är detta för ett tilltag, att du\\nhar stulit dig undan från mig och fört bort mina döttrar,\\nlikasom vore de tagna med svärd?\\nVarför dolde du din flykt och stal dig undan från mig?\\nDärigenom att du icke lät mig veta något därom hindrades jag att\\nledsaga dig till vägs med jubel och sång, med pukor och harpor.\\nDu förunnade mig icke ens att kyssa mina barnbarn och mina\\ndöttrar.  Du har handlat dåraktigt.\\nDet stode nu i min makt att göra eder ont; men eder faders Gud\\nsade till mig i natt: \\'Tag dig till vara för att tala något mot\\nJakob, vad det vara må.\\'\\nOch då du nu äntligen ville fara, eftersom du längtade så mycket\\ntill din faders hus, varför skulle du stjäla mina gudar?╜\\nDå svarade Jakob och sade till Laban: ╜Jag fruktade för dig, ty\\njag tänkte att du skulle med våld taga dina döttrar ifrån mig.\\nMen den som du finner dina gudar hos, han skall icke få behålla\\nlivet.  I våra fränders närvaro må du se efter, om något är ditt\\nav det jag har i min ägo, och i så fall taga det.╜  Ty Jakob\\nvisste icke att Rakel hade stulit dem.\\nDå gick Laban in i Jakobs tält, därefter i Leas tält och i de\\nbåda tjänstekvinnornas tält, men fann intet.  Och när han hade\\nkommit ut ur Leas tält, gick han in i Rakels tält.\\nMen Rakel hade tagit husgudarna och lagt dem i kamelsadeln och\\nsatt sig därovanpå.  Och Laban sökte igenom hela tältet, men\\nfann dem icke.\\nOch hon sade till sin fader: ╜Vredgas icke, min herre, över att\\njag ej kan stiga upp för dig, ty det är med mig på kvinnors\\nvis.╜  Så sökte han efter husgudarna, men fann dem icke.\\n\\nDå blev Jakob vred och for ut mot Laban; Jakob tog till orda och\\nsade till Laban: ╜Vari har jag då förbrutit mig eller syndat,\\neftersom du så häftigt förföljer mig?\\nNu har du genomsökt allt mitt bohag; vad har du där funnit av\\nbohagsting som tillhöra dig?  Lägg det fram här inför mina\\nfränder och dina fränder, så att de få döma mellan oss båda.\\nI tjugu år har jag nu varit hos dig; dina tackor och dina getter\\nhava icke fött i otid, och av vädurarna i din hjord har jag icke\\nätit.\\nIntet ihjälrivet djur förde jag till dig; jag måste själv\\nersätta det; du utkrävde det av mig, evad det var stulet om\\ndagen eller stulet om natten.\\nSådan var min lott: om dagen förtärdes jag av hetta och om\\nnatten av köld, och sömnen flydde mina ögon.\\nI tjugu år har jag nu varit i ditt hus; jag har tjänat dig i\\nfjorton år för dina båda döttrar och i sex år för din boskap,\\nmen du har tio gånger förändrat min lön.\\nOm icke min faders Gud hade varit med mig, Abrahams Gud, han som\\nock Isak fruktar, så hade du nu säkert låtit mig fara med tomma\\nhänder.  Men Gud såg mitt lidande och min möda, och han fällde\\ndomen i natt.╜\\nDå svarade Laban och sade till Jakob: ╜Döttrarna äro mina\\ndöttrar, och barnen äro mina barn, och hjordarna äro mina\\nhjordar, och allt det du ser är mitt; vad skulle jag då nu kunna\\ngöra mot dessa mina döttrar eller mot barnen som de hava fött?\\nSå kom nu och låt oss sluta ett förbund med varandra, och må det\\nvara ett vittne mellan mig och dig.╜\\n\\nDå tog Jakob en sten och reste den till en stod.\\nOch Jakob sade till sina fränder: ╜Samlen tillhopa stenar.╜  Och\\nde togo stenar och gjorde ett röse och höllo måltid där på\\nröset.\\nOch Laban kallade det <spärr>Jegar-Sahaduta</spärr>, men Jakob\\nkallade det <spärr>Galed</spärr>.\\nOch Laban sade: ╜Detta röse vare i dag vittne mellan mig och\\ndig.╜  Därav fick det namnet Galed;\\nmen det kallades ock <spärr>Mispa</spärr>, ty han sade:\\n╜HERREN vare väktare mellan mig och dig, när vi icke mer se\\nvarandra.\\nOm du behandlar mina döttrar illa eller tager andra hustrur\\njämte mina döttrar, så vet, att om ock ingen människa är\\ntillstädes, så är dock Gud vittne mellan mig och dig.╜\\nOch Laban sade ytterligare till Jakob: ╜Se, detta röse och\\nstoden som jag har rest mellan mig och dig --\\ndetta röse vare ett vittne, och stoden vare ett vittne, att jag\\nicke skall draga till dig förbi detta röse, och att icke heller\\ndu skall draga till mig förbi detta röse och denna stod, med ont\\nuppsåt.\\nAbrahams Gud och Nahors Gud, han som var deras faders Gud, han\\nvare domare mellan oss.╜  Och Jakob svor eden vid honom som hans\\nfader Isak fruktade.\\nOch Jakob offrade ett slaktoffer på berget och inbjöd sina\\nfränder att hålla måltid med sig.  Och de åto och stannade sedan\\npå berget över natten.\\nMen om morgonen stod Laban bittida upp, och sedan han hade kysst\\nsina barnbarn och sina döttrar och välsignat dem, for han sin\\nväg hem igen.\\n\\nMen när Jakob drog sin väg fram, mötte honom Guds änglar;\\noch då Jakob såg dem, sade han: ╜Detta är Guds skara.╜  Och han\\ngav den platsen namnet <spärr>Mahanaim</spärr>.\\n\\nOch Jakob sände budbärare framför sig till sin broder Esau i\\nSeirs land, på Edoms mark;\\noch han bjöd dem och sade: ╜Så skolen I säga till min herre\\nEsau: Din tjänare Jakob låter säga: Jag har vistats borta hos\\nLaban och dröjt kvar där ända till nu;\\noch jag har fått oxar, åsnor, får, tjänare och tjänarinnor.  Och\\njag har nu velat sända bud för att låta min herre veta detta, på\\ndet att jag må finna nåd för dina ögon.╜\\n\\nNär sedan budbärarna kommo tillbaka till Jakob, sade de: ╜Vi\\nträffade din broder Esau, som redan drager emot dig med fyra\\nhundra man.╜\\nDå blev Jakob mycket förskräckt och betogs av ångest; och han\\ndelade sitt folk och fåren och fäkreaturen och kamelerna i två\\nskaror.\\nTy han tänkte: ╜Om Esau överfaller den ena skaran och slår den,\\nså kan dock den andra skaran undkomma.╜\\n\\nOch Jakob sade: ╜Min fader Abrahams Gud och min fader Isaks Gud,\\nHERRE, du som sade till mig: \\'Vänd tillbaka till ditt land och\\ntill din släkt, så skall jag göra dig gott\\',\\njag är för ringa till all den nåd och all den trofasthet som du\\nhar bevisat din tjänare; ty jag hade icke mer än min stav, när\\njag gick över denna Jordan, och nu har jag förökats till två\\nskaror.\\nRädda mig undan min broder Esaus hand, ty jag fruktar att han\\nkommer och förgör mig, utan att ens skona mödrar och barn.\\nDu har själv sagt: \\'Jag skall göra dig mycket gott och låta din\\nsäd bliva såsom havets sand, som man icke kan räkna för dess\\nmyckenhets skull.\\'╜\\nOch han stannade där den natten.\\n\\nOch av det han hade förvärvat tog han ut till skänker åt sin\\nbroder Esau\\ntvå hundra getter och tjugu bockar, två hundra tackor och tjugu\\nvädurar,\\ntrettio kamelston som gåvo di, jämte deras föl, därtill fyrtio\\nkor och tio tjurar samt tjugu åsninnor med tio föl.\\nOch han lämnade detta i sina tjänares vård, var hjord för sig,\\noch sade till sina tjänare: ╜Gån framför mig och låten ett\\nmellanrum vara mellan hjordarna.╜\\nOch han bjöd den förste och sade: ╜När min broder Esau möter dig\\noch frågar dig: \\'Vem tillhör du, och vart går du, och vem\\ntillhöra djuren som du driver framför dig?\\',\\ndå skall du svara: \\'De tillhöra din tjänare Jakob; de äro\\nskänker som han sänder till min herre Esau, och själv kommer han\\nhär efter oss.\\'╜\\nOch han bjöd likaledes den andre och den tredje och alla de\\növriga som drevo hjordarna: ╜Såsom jag nu har sagt eder skolen I\\nsäga till Esau, när I kommen fram till honom.\\nOch I skolen vidare säga: \\'Också din tjänare Jakob kommer här\\nefter oss.\\'╜  Ty han tänkte: ╜Jag vill blidka honom med de\\nskänker som gå före mig; sedan vill jag själv komma inför hans\\nansikte; kanhända tager han då nådigt emot mig.╜\\nSå kommo nu skänkerna före honom, medan han själv den natten\\nstannade i lägret.\\n\\nMen under natten stod han upp och tog sina båda hustrur och\\nsina båda tjänstekvinnor och sina elva söner och gick över\\nJabboks vad.\\nHan tog dem och förde dem över bäcken och förde tillika över vad\\nhan eljest ägde.\\nOch Jakob blev ensam kvar.  Då brottades en man med honom, till\\ndess morgonrodnaden gick upp.\\nOch när denne såg att han icke kunde övervinna Jakob, gav han\\nhonom ett slag på höftleden, så att höften gick ur led, under\\ndet han brottades med honom.\\nOch mannen sade: ╜Släpp mig, ty morgonrodnaden går upp.╜  Men\\nhan svarade: ╜Jag släpper dig icke, med mindre du välsignar\\nmig.╜\\nDå sade han till honom: ╜Vad är ditt namn?╜  Han svarade:\\n╜Jakob.╜\\nHan sade: ╜Du skall icke mer heta Jakob, utan Israel, ty du har\\n<spärr>kämpat</spärr> med <spärr>Gud</spärr> och med\\nmänniskor och vunnit seger.╜\\nDå frågade Jakob och sade: ╜Låt mig veta ditt namn.╜  Han\\nsvarade: ╜Varför frågar du efter mitt namn?╜  Och han välsignade\\nhonom där.\\nMen Jakob gav platsen namnet <spärr>Peniel</spärr>, ╜ty╜,\\nsade han, ╜jag har sett Gud ansikte mot ansikte, och dock har\\nmitt liv blivit räddat╜.\\nOch när han hade kommit förbi Penuel, såg han solen gå upp; men\\nhan haltade på höften.\\nFördenskull äta Israels barn ännu i dag icke höftsenan som\\nligger på höftleden, därför nämligen, att han gav Jakob ett slag\\npå höftleden, på höftsenan.\\n\\nOch Jakob lyfte upp sina ögon och fick se Esau komma med fyra\\nhundra man.  Då fördelade han sina barn på Lea och Rakel och de\\nbåda tjänstekvinnorna.\\nOch han lät tjänstekvinnorna med deras barn gå främst, Lea med\\nhennes barn därnäst, och Rakel med Josef sist.\\nOch själv gick han framför dem och bugade sig sju gånger ned\\ntill jorden, till dess han kom fram till sin broder.\\nMen Esau skyndade emot honom och tog honom i famn och föll honom\\nom halsen och kysste honom; och de gräto.\\nOch när han lyfte upp sina ögon och fick se kvinnorna och\\nbarnen, sade han: ╜Vilka äro dessa som du har med dig?╜  Han\\nsvarade: ╜Det är barnen som Gud har beskärt din tjänare.╜\\nOch tjänstekvinnorna gingo fram med sina barn och bugade sig.\\nDärefter gick ock Lea fram med sina barn, och de bugade sig.\\nSlutligen gingo Josef och Rakel fram och bugade sig.\\nSedan frågade han: ╜Vad ville du med hela den skara som jag\\nmötte?╜  Han svarade: ╜Jag ville finna nåd för min herres ögon.╜\\nMen Esau sade: ╜Jag har nog; behåll du vad du har, min broder.╜\\nJakob svarade: ╜Ack nej; om jag har funnit nåd för dina ögon, så\\ntag emot skänkerna av mig, eftersom jag har fått se ditt\\nansikte, likasom såge jag ett gudaväsens ansikte, då du nu så\\ngunstigt har tagit emot mig.\\nTag hälsningsskänkerna som jag har skickat emot dig; ty Gud har\\nvarit mig nådig, och jag har allt fullt upp.╜  Och han bad honom\\nså enträget, att han tog emot dem.\\n\\nOch Esau sade: ╜Låt oss bryta upp och draga vidare; jag vill gå\\nframför dig.╜\\nMen han svarade honom: ╜Min herre ser själv att barnen äro\\nspäda, och att jag har med mig får och kor som giva di; driver\\nman dessa för starkt en enda dag, så dör hela hjorden.\\nMå därför min herre draga åstad före sin tjänare, så vill jag\\nkomma efter i sakta mak, i den mån boskapen, som drives framför\\nmig, och barnen orka följa med, till dess jag kommer till min\\nherre i Seir.╜\\nDå sade Esau: ╜Så vill jag åtminstone lämna kvar hos dig en del\\nav mitt folk.╜  Men han svarade: ╜Varför så?  Må jag allenast\\nfinna nåd för min herres ögon.╜\\nSå vände Esau om, samma dag, och tog vägen till Seir.\\n\\nMen Jakob bröt upp och drog till Suckot och byggde sig där ett\\nhus.  Och åt sin boskap gjorde han <spärr>lövhyddor</spärr>;\\ndärav fick platsen namnet Suckot.\\n\\nOch Jakob kom på sin färd ifrån Paddan-Aram välbehållen till\\nSikems stad i Kanaans land och slog upp sitt läger utanför\\nstaden.\\nOch det jordstycke där han hade slagit upp sitt tält köpte han\\nav Hamors, Sikems faders, barn för hundra kesitor.\\nOch han reste där ett altare och kallade det\\n<spärr>El-Elohe-Israel</spärr>.\\n\\nMen Dina, den dotter som Lea hade fött åt Jakob, gick ut för att\\nbesöka landets döttrar.\\nOch Sikem, som var son till hivéen Hamor, hövdingen i landet,\\nfick se henne, och han tog henne till sig och lägrade henne och\\nkränkte henne.\\nOch hans hjärta fäste sig vid Dina, Jakobs dotter, och flickan\\nblev honom kär, och han talade vänligt med flickan.\\nOch Sikem sade till sin fader Hamor: ╜Skaffa mig denna flicka\\ntill hustru.╜\\n\\nOch Jakob hade fått höra att hans dotter Dina hade blivit\\nskändad.  Men eftersom hans söner voro med hans boskap ute på\\nmarken, teg Jakob, till dess de kommo hem.\\nSå gick nu Hamor, Sikems fader, ut till Jakob för att tala med\\nhonom.\\nMen när Jakobs söner kommo hem från marken, sedan de hade fått\\nhöra vad som hade hänt, blevo de förbittrade och vredgades\\nhögeligen över att han hade gjort vad som var en galenskap i\\nIsrael, i det han hade lägrat Jakobs dotter -- en otillbörlig\\ngärning.\\nDå talade Hamor med dem och sade: ╜Min son Sikems hjärta har\\nfäst sig vid eder syster; given henne åt honom till hustru.\\nOch befrynden eder med oss; given edra döttrar åt oss, och\\ntagen I våra döttrar till hustrur,\\noch bosätten eder hos oss, ty landet skall ligga öppet för eder;\\ndär mån I bo och draga omkring och förvärva besittningar.╜\\nOch Sikem sade till hennes fader och hennes bröder: ╜Låten mig\\nfinna nåd för edra ögon; vad I fordren av mig vill jag giva.\\nBegären av mig huru stor brudgåva och skänk som helst; jag vill\\ngiva vad I fordren av mig; given mig allenast flickan till\\nhustru.╜\\nDå svarade Jakobs söner Sikem och hans fader Hamor med listiga\\nord, eftersom han hade skändat deras syster Dina,\\noch sade till dem: ╜Vi kunna icke samtycka till att giva vår\\nsyster åt en man som har förhud; ty sådant hålla vi för\\nskamligt.\\nAllenast på det villkoret skola vi göra eder till viljes, att I\\nbliven såsom vi, därigenom att allt mankön bland eder omskäres.\\nDå skola vi giva våra döttrar åt eder och själva taga edra\\ndöttrar till hustrur; och vi skola då bo hos eder och bliva med\\neder ett enda folk.\\nMen om I icke viljen lyssna till oss och låta omskära eder, så\\nskola vi taga vår syster och draga bort.╜\\nOch Hamor och Sikem, Hamors son, voro till freds med vad de\\nbegärde.\\n\\nOch den unge mannen dröjde icke att göra så, ty han hade fått\\nbehag till Jakobs dotter.  Och han hade större myndighet än\\nnågon annan i hans faders hus.\\nSå trädde då Hamor och hans son Sikem upp i sin stads port och\\ntalade till männen i staden och sade:\\n╜Dessa män äro fredligt sinnade mot oss; må vi alltså låta dem\\nbo i landet och draga omkring där; landet har ju utrymme nog för\\ndem.  Vi vilja taga deras döttrar till hustrur åt oss och giva\\ndem våra döttrar.\\nMen allenast på det villkoret skola männen göra oss till viljes\\noch bo hos oss och bliva ett enda folk med oss, att allt mankön\\nbland oss omskäres, likasom de själva äro omskurna.\\nOch då bliva ju deras boskap och deras egendom och alla deras\\ndragare vår tillhörighet.  Må vi fördenskull allenast göra dem\\ntill viljes, så skola de bo kvar hos oss.╜\\nOch folket lydde Hamor och hans son Sikem, alla de som bodde\\ninom hans stadsport; allt mankön, så många som bodde inom hans\\nstadsport, läto omskära sig.\\n\\nMen på tredje dagen, då de voro sjuka av såren, togo Jakobs två\\nsöner Simeon och Levi, Dinas bröder, var sitt svärd och\\növerföllo staden oförtänkt och dräpte allt mankön.\\nOckså Hamor och hans son Sikem dräpte de med svärdsegg och togo\\nDina ut ur Sikems hus och gingo sin väg.\\nOch Jakobs söner kommo över de slagna och plundrade staden,\\ndärför att deras syster hade blivit skändad;\\nde togo deras får och fäkreatur och åsnor, både vad som fanns i\\nstaden och vad som fanns på fältet.\\nOch allt deras gods och alla deras barn och deras kvinnor förde\\nde bort såsom byte, tillika med allt annat som fanns i husen.\\n\\nMen Jakob sade till Simeon och Levi: ╜I haven dragit olycka över\\nmig, då I nu haven gjort mig förhatlig för landets inbyggare,\\nkananéerna och perisséerna.  Mitt folk är allenast en ringa hop;\\nman skall nu församla sig mot mig och slå mig ihjäl; så skall\\njag med mitt hus förgöras.╜\\nMen de svarade: ╜Skulle man då få behandla vår syster såsom en\\nsköka?╜\\nOch Gud sade till Jakob: ╜Stå upp, drag till Betel och stanna\\ndär, och res där ett altare åt den Gud som uppenbarade sig för\\ndig, när du flydde för din broder Esau.╜\\nDå sade Jakob till sitt husfolk och till alla som voro med\\nhonom: ╜Skaffen bort de främmande gudar som I haven bland eder,\\noch renen eder och byten om kläder,\\noch låt oss så stå upp och draga till Betel; där vill jag resa\\nett altare åt den Gud som bönhörde mig, när jag var i nöd, och\\nsom var med mig på den väg jag vandrade.╜\\nDå gåvo de åt Jakob alla de främmande gudar som de hade hos sig,\\ndärtill ock sina örringar; och Jakob grävde ned detta under\\nterebinten vid Sikem.\\nSedan bröto de upp; och en förskräckelse ifrån Gud kom över de\\nkringliggande städerna, så att man icke förföljde Jakobs söner.\\nOch Jakob kom till Lus, det är Betel, i Kanaans land, jämte allt\\ndet folk som var med honom.\\nOch han byggde där ett altare och kallade platsen\\n<spärr>El-Betel</spärr>, därför att Gud där hade uppenbarat\\nsig för honom, när han flydde för sin broder.\\nOch Debora, Rebeckas amma, dog och blev begraven nedanför Betel,\\nunder en ek; den fick namnet Gråtoeken.\\n\\nOch Gud uppenbarade sig åter för Jakob, när han hade kommit\\ntillbaka från Paddan-Aram, och välsignade honom.\\nOch Gud sade till honom: ╜Ditt namn är Jakob; men du skall icke\\nmer heta Jakob, utan Israel skall vara ditt namn.╜  Så fick han\\nnamnet Israel.\\nOch Gud sade till honom: ╜Jag är Gud den Allsmäktige; var\\nfruktsam och föröka dig.  Ett folk, ja, skaror av folk skola\\nkomma av dig, och konungar skola utgå från din länd.\\nOch det land som jag har givit åt Abraham och Isak skall jag\\ngiva åt dig; åt din säd efter dig skall jag ock giva det landet.\\nOch Gud for upp från honom, på den plats där han hade talat med\\nhonom.\\nMen Jakob reste en stod på den plats där han hade talat med\\nhonom, en stod av sten; och han offrade drickoffer därpå och göt\\nolja över den.\\nOch Jakob gav åt platsen där Gud hade talat med honom namnet\\nBetel.\\nSedan bröto de upp från Betel.  Och när det ännu var ett stycke\\nväg fram till Efrat, kom Rakel i barnsnöd, och barnsnöden blev\\nhenne svår.\\nDå nu hennes barnsnöd var som svårast, sade hjälpkvinnan till\\nhenne: ╜Frukta icke; ty också denna gång får du en son.╜\\nMen när hon höll på att giva upp andan, ty hon skulle nu dö, gav\\nhon honom namnet <spärr>Ben-Oni</spärr>; men hans fader kallade honom\\n<spärr>Benjamin</spärr>.\\nSå dog Rakel, och hon blev begraven vid vägen till Efrat, det är\\nBet-Lehem.\\nOch Jakob reste en vård på hennes grav; det är den som ännu i\\ndag kallas Rakels gravvård.\\n\\nOch Israel bröt upp därifrån och slog upp sitt tält på andra\\nsidan om Herdetornet.\\nOch medan Israel bodde där i landet, gick Ruben åstad och\\nlägrade Bilha, sin faders bihustru; och Israel fick höra det.\\n\\nOch Jakob hade tolv söner.\\nLeas söner voro Ruben, Jakobs förstfödde, vidare Simeon, Levi,\\nJuda, Isaskar och Sebulon.\\nRakels söner voro Josef och Benjamin.\\nBilhas, Rakels tjänstekvinnas, söner voro Dan och Naftali.\\nSilpas, Leas tjänstekvinnas, söner voro Gad och Aser.  Dessa\\nvoro Jakobs söner, och de föddes åt honom i Paddan-Aram.\\nOch Jakob kom till sin fader Isak i Mamre vid Kirjat-Arba, det\\när Hebron, där Abraham och Isak hade bott såsom främlingar.\\nOch Isak levde ett hundra åttio år;\\ndärefter gav Isak upp andan och dog och blev samlad till sina\\nfäder, gammal och mätt på att leva.

När Josef var sjutton år\\ngammal, gick han, jämte sina bröder, i vall med fåren; han följde\\ndå såsom yngling med Bilhas och Silpas, sin faders hustrurs,\\nsöner.  Och Josef bar fram till deras fader vad ont som sades om\\ndem.\\nMen Israel hade Josef kärare än alla sina andra söner, eftersom\\nhan hade fött honom på sin ålderdom; och han lät göra åt honom\\nen fotsid livklädnad.\\nDå nu hans bröder sågo att deras fader hade honom kärare än alla\\nhans bröder, blevo de hätska mot honom och kunde icke tala\\nvänligt till honom.\\nDärtill hade Josef en gång en dröm, som han omtalade för sina\\nbröder; sedan hatade de honom ännu mer.\\nHan sade nämligen till dem: ╜Hören vilken dröm jag har haft.\\nJag tyckte att vi bundo kärvar på fältet; och se, min kärve\\nreste sig upp och blev stående, och edra kärvar ställde sig runt\\nomkring och bugade sig för min kärve.╜\\nDå sade hans bröder till honom: ╜Skulle du bliva vår konung, och\\nskulle du råda över oss?╜  Och de hatade honom ännu mer för hans\\ndrömmars skull och för vad han hade sagt.\\n\\nSedan hade han ännu en annan dröm som han förtäljde för sina\\nbröder; han sade: ╜Hören, jag har haft ännu en dröm.  Jag tyckte\\natt solen och månen och elva stjärnor bugade sig för mig.╜\\nNär han förtäljde detta för sin fader och sina bröder, bannade\\nhans fader honom och sade till honom: ╜Vad är detta för en dröm\\nsom du har haft?  Skulle då jag och din moder och dina bröder\\nkomma och buga oss ned till jorden för dig?╜\\nOch hans bröder avundades honom; men hans fader bevarade detta i\\nsitt minne.\\n\\nDå nu en gång hans bröder hade gått bort för att vakta sin\\nfaders får i Sikem,\\nsade Israel till Josef: ╜Se, dina bröder vakta fåren i Sikem;\\ngör dig redo, jag vill sända dig till dem.╜  Han svarade honom:\\n╜Jag är redo.╜\\nDå sade han till honom: ╜Gå och se efter, om det står väl till\\nmed dina bröder, och om det står väl till med fåren, och kom\\ntillbaka till mig med svar.╜  Så sände han honom åstad från\\nHebrons dal, och han kom till Sikem.\\nDär mötte han en man, medan han gick omkring villrådig på\\nfältet; och mannen frågade honom: ╜Vad söker du?╜\\nHan svarade: ╜Jag söker efter mina bröder; säg mig var de vakta\\nsin hjord.╜\\nMannen svarade: ╜De hava brutit upp härifrån; ty jag hörde dem\\nsäga: \\'Låt oss gå till Dotain.\\'╜  Då gick Josef vidare efter\\nsina bröder och fann dem i Dotan.\\nNär de nu på avstånd fingo se honom, innan han ännu hade hunnit\\nfram till dem, lade de råd om att döda honom.\\nDe sade till varandra: ╜Se, där kommer drömmaren.\\nUpp, låt oss dräpa honom och kasta honom i en brunn; sedan kunna\\nvi säga att ett vilddjur har ätit upp honom.  Så få vi se huru\\ndet går med hans drömmar.╜\\nMen när Ruben hörde detta, ville han rädda honom undan deras\\nhänder och sade: ╜Låt oss icke slå ihjäl honom.╜\\nYtterligare sade Ruben till dem: ╜Utgjuten icke blod; kasten\\nhonom i brunnen här i öknen, men bären icke hand på honom.╜  Han\\nville nämligen rädda honom undan deras händer och föra honom\\ntillbaka till hans fader.\\nDå nu Josef kom fram till sina bröder, togo de av honom hans\\nlivklädnad, den fotsida klädnaden som han hade på sig,\\noch grepo honom och kastade honom i brunnen; men brunnen var\\ntom, intet vatten fanns däri.\\nDärefter satte de sig ned för att äta.  När de då lyfte upp sina\\nögon, fingo de se ett tåg av ismaeliter komma från Gilead, och\\nderas kameler voro lastade med dragantgummi, balsam och\\nladanum; de voro på väg med detta ned till Egypten.\\nDå sade Juda till sina bröder: ╜Vad gagn hava vi därav att vi\\ndräpa vår broder och dölja hans blod?╜\\nNej, låt oss sälja honom till ismaeliterna; må vår hand icke\\nkomma vid honom, ty han är ju vår broder, vårt eget kött.╜  Och\\nhans bröder lydde honom.\\nDå nu midjanitiska köpmän kommo där förbi, drogo de upp Josef ur\\nbrunnen; och de sålde Josef för tjugu siklar silver till\\nismaeliterna.  Dessa förde så Josef till Egypten.\\n\\nNär sedan Ruben kom tillbaka till brunnen, se, då fanns Josef\\nicke i brunnen.  Då rev han sönder sina kläder\\noch vände tillbaka till sina bröder och sade: ╜Gossen är icke\\ndär, vart skall jag nu taga vägen?╜\\nMen de togo Josefs livklädnad och slaktade en bock och doppade\\nklädnaden i blodet;\\ndärefter sände de den fotsida livklädnaden hem till sin fader\\noch läto säga: ╜Denna har vi funnit; se efter, om det är din\\nsons livklädnad eller icke.╜\\nOch han kände igen den och sade: ╜Det är min sons livklädnad;\\nett vilddjur har ätit upp honom, förvisso är Josef ihjälriven.╜\\nOch Jakob rev sönder sina kläder och svepte säcktyg om sina\\nländer och sörjde sin son i lång tid.\\nOch alla hans söner och alla hans döttrar kommo för att trösta\\nhonom; men han ville icke låta trösta sig, utan sade: ╜Jag skall\\nmed sorg fara ned i dödsriket till min son.╜  Så begrät hans\\nfader honom.\\n\\nMen medaniterna förde honom till Egypten och sålde honom till\\nPotifar, som var hovman hos Farao och hövitsman för drabanterna.\\nVid den tiden begav sig Juda åstad bort ifrån sina bröder och\\nslöt sig till en man i Adullam, som hette Hira.\\nDär fick Juda se dottern till en kananeisk man som hette Sua,\\noch han tog henne till sig och gick in till henne.\\nOch hon blev havande och födde en son, och han fick namnet Er.\\nÅter blev hon havande och födde en son och gav honom namnet\\nOnan.\\nOch hon födde ännu en son, och åt denne gav hon namnet Sela; och\\nnär han föddes, var Juda i Kesib.\\nOch Juda tog åt Er, sin förstfödde, en hustru som hette Tamar.\\nMen Er, Judas förstfödde, misshagade HERREN; därför dödade\\nHERREN honom.\\nDå sade Juda till Onan: ╜Gå in till din broders hustru, äkta\\nhenne i din broders ställe och skaffa avkomma åt din broder.╜\\nMen eftersom Onan visste att avkomman icke skulle bliva hans\\negen, lät han, när han gick in till sin broders hustru, det\\nspillas på jorden, för att icke giva avkomma åt sin broder.\\nMen det misshagade HERREN att han gjorde så; därför dödade han\\nockså honom.\\nDå sade Juda till sin sonhustru Tamar: ╜Stanna såsom änka i din\\nfaders hus, till dess min son Sela bliver fullvuxen.╜  Han\\nfruktade nämligen att annars också denne skulle dö, likasom hans\\nbröder.  Så gick Tamar bort och stannade i sin faders hus.\\n\\nEn lång tid därefter dog Suas dotter, Judas hustru.  Och efter\\nsorgetidens slut gick Juda med sin vän adullamiten Hira upp till\\nTimna, för att se efter dem som klippte hans får.\\nNär man nu berättade för Tamar att hennes svärfader gick upp\\ntill Timna för att klippa sina får,\\nlade hon av sig sina änkekläder och betäckte sig med en slöja\\noch höljde in sig och satte sig vid porten till Enaim på vägen\\ntill Timna.  Ty hon såg, att fastän Sela var fullvuxen, blev hon\\nlikväl icke given åt honom till hustru.\\nDå nu Juda fick se henne, trodde han att hon var en sköka; hon\\nhade ju nämligen sitt ansikte betäckt.\\nOch han vek av till henne, där hon satt vid vägen, och sade:\\n╜Kom, låt mig gå in till dig.╜  Ty han visste icke att det var\\nhans sonhustru.  Hon svarade: ╜Vad vill du giva mig för att få\\ngå in till mig?╜\\nHan sade: ╜Jag vill sända dig en killing ur min hjord.╜  Hon\\nsvarade: ╜Ja, om du giver mig pant, till dess du sänder den.╜\\nHan sade: ╜Vad skall jag då giva dig i pant?╜  Hon svarade: ╜Din\\nsignetring, din snodd och staven som du har i din hand.╜  Då gav\\nhan henne detta och gick in till henne, och hon blev havande\\ngenom honom.\\nOch hon stod upp och gick därifrån och lade av sin slöja och\\nklädde sig åter i sina änkekläder.\\nOch Juda sände killingen med sin vän adullamiten, för att få\\nigen panten av kvinnan; men denne fann henne icke.\\nOch han frågade folket där på orten och sade: ╜Var är\\ntempeltärnan, hon som satt i Enaim vid vägen?╜  De svarade: ╜Här\\nhar ingen tempeltärna varit.╜\\nOch han kom tillbaka till Juda och sade: ╜Jag har icke funnit\\nhenne; därtill säger folket på orten att ingen tempeltärna har\\nvarit där.╜\\nDå sade Juda: ╜Må hon då behålla det, så att vi icke draga\\nsmälek över oss.  Jag har nu sänt killingen, men du har icke\\nfunnit henne.╜\\n\\nVid pass tre månader därefter blev så berättat för Juda: ╜Din\\nsonhustru Tamar har bedrivit otukt, och i otukt har hon blivit\\nhavande.╜  Juda sade: ╜Fören ut henne till att brännas.╜\\nMen när hon fördes ut, sände hon bud till sin svärfader och lät\\nsäga: ╜Genom en man som är ägare till detta har jag blivit\\nhavande.╜  Och hon lät säga: ╜Se efter, vem denna signetring,\\ndessa snodder och denna stav tillhöra.╜\\nOch Juda kände igen dem och sade: ╜Hon är i sin rätt mot mig,\\neftersom jag icke har givit henne åt min son Sela.╜  Men han kom\\nicke mer vid henne.\\n\\nNär hon nu skulle föda, se, då funnos tvillingar i hennes liv.\\nOch i födslostunden stack den ene fram en hand; då tog\\nhjälpkvinnan en röd tråd och band den om hans hand och sade:\\n╜Denne kom först fram.╜\\nMen när han därefter åter drog sin hand tillbaka, se, då kom\\nhans broder fram; och hon sade: ╜Varför har du trängt dig fram?╜\\nOch han fick namnet <spärr>Peres</spärr>.\\nDärefter kom hans broder fram, han som hade den röda tråden om\\nsin hand, och han fick namnet Sera.\\n\\nOch Josef fördes ned till Egypten; och Potifar, som var hovman\\nhos Farao och hövitsman för drabanterna, en egyptisk man, köpte\\nhonom av ismaeliterna som hade fört honom ditned.\\nOch HERREN var med Josef, så att han blev en lyckosam man.  Och\\nhan vistades i sin herres, egyptierns, hus;\\noch hans herre såg att HERREN var med honom, ty allt vad han\\ngjorde lät HERREN lyckas väl under hans hand.\\nOch Josef fann nåd för hans ögon och fick betjäna honom.  Och\\nhan satte honom över sitt hus, och allt vad han ägde lämnade han\\ni hans vård.\\nOch från den stund då han hade satt honom över sitt hus och över\\nallt vad han ägde, välsignade HERREN egyptierns hus, för Josefs\\nskull; och HERRENS välsignelse vilade över allt vad han ägde,\\nhemma och på marken.\\nDärför överlät han i Josefs vård allt vad han ägde, och sedan\\nhan hade fått honom till sin hjälp, bekymrade han sig icke om\\nnågot, utom maten som han själv åt.\\n\\nMen Josef hade en skön gestalt och var skön att skåda.\\nOch efter en tid hände sig att hans herres hustru kastade sina\\nögon på Josef och sade: ╜Ligg hos mig.╜\\nMen han ville icke, utan sade till sin herres hustru: ╜Se,\\nalltsedan min herre har tagit mig till sin hjälp, bekymrar han\\nsig icke om något i huset, och allt vad han äger har han lämnat\\ni min vård.\\nHan har i detta hus icke större makt än jag, och intet annat har\\nhan förbehållit sig än dig allena, eftersom du är hans hustru.\\nHuru skulle jag då kunna göra så mycket ont och synda mot Gud?╜\\nOch fastän hon talade sådant dag efter dag till Josef, hörde han\\ndock icke på henne och ville icke ligga hos henne eller vara med\\nhenne.\\nMen en dag då han kom in i huset för att förrätta sina sysslor,\\noch ingen av husfolket var tillstädes därinne,\\nfattade hon honom i manteln och sade: ╜Ligg hos mig.╜  Men han\\nlämnade manteln i hennes hand och flydde och kom ut.\\nDå hon nu såg att han hade lämnat sin mantel i hennes hand och\\nflytt ut,\\nropade hon på sitt husfolk och sade till dem: ╜Sen här, han har\\nfört hit till oss en hebreisk man, för att denne skulle locka\\noss till lättfärdighet.  Han kom in till mig och ville ligga hos\\nmig; men jag ropade med hög röst.\\nOch när han hörde att jag hov upp min röst och ropade, lämnade\\nhan sin mantel kvar hos mig och flydde och kom ut.╜\\nOch hon lät hans mantel ligga kvar hos sig, till dess hans herre\\nkom hem;\\ndå berättade hon för honom detsamma; hon sade: ╜Den hebreiske\\ntjänaren som du har fört hit till oss kom in till mig, och\\nville locka mig till lättfärdighet.\\nMen då jag hov upp min röst och ropade, lämnade han sin mantel\\nkvar hos mig och flydde ut.╜\\nNär nu hans herre hörde vad hans hustru berättade för honom,\\nnämligen att hans tjänare hade betett sig mot henne på detta\\nsätt, blev hans vrede upptänd.\\nOch Josefs herre tog honom och lät sätta honom i det fängelse\\ndär konungens fångar sutto fängslade; där fick han då vara i\\nfängelse.\\nMen HERREN var med Josef och förskaffade honom ynnest och lät\\nhonom finna nåd hos föreståndaren för fängelset.\\nOch föreståndaren för fängelset lät alla fångar som sutto i\\nfängelset stå under Josefs uppsikt; och allt vad där skulle\\ngöras, det gjordes genom honom.\\nFöreståndaren för fängelset tog sig alls icke av något som Josef\\nhade om hand, eftersom HERREN var med denne; och vad han gjorde,\\ndet lät HERREN lyckas väl.\\nEn tid härefter hände sig att den egyptiske konungens munskänk\\noch hans bagare försyndade sig mot sin herre, konungen av\\nEgypten.\\nOch Farao blev förtörnad på sina två hovmän, överste munskänken\\noch överste bagaren,\\noch lät sätta dem i förvar i drabanthövitsmannens hus, i samma\\nfängelse där Josef satt fången.\\nOch hövitsmannen för drabanterna anställde Josef hos dem till\\natt betjäna dem; och de sutto där i förvar en tid.\\n\\nMedan nu den egyptiske konungens munskänk och bagare sutto\\nfångna i fängelset, hade de båda under samma natt var sin dröm,\\nvardera med sin särskilda betydelse.\\nOch när Josef om morgonen kom in till dem, fick han se att de\\nvoro bedrövade.\\nDå frågade han Faraos hovmän, som med honom sutto i förvar i\\nhans herres hus: ╜Varför sen I så sorgsna ut i dag?╜\\nDe svarade honom: ╜Vi hava haft en dröm, och ingen finnes, som\\nkan uttyda den.╜  Josef sade till dem: ╜Att giva uttydningen är\\nju Guds sak; förtäljen drömmen för mig.╜\\n\\nDå förtäljde överste munskänken sin dröm för Josef och sade till\\nhonom: ╜Jag drömde att ett vinträd stod framför mig;\\npå vinträdet voro tre rankor, och knappt hade det skjutit skott,\\nså slogo dess blommor ut och dess klasar buro mogna druvor.\\nOch jag hade Faraos bägare i min hand, och jag tog druvorna och\\npressade ut dem i Faraos bägare och gav Farao bägaren i handen.╜\\nDå sade Josef till honom: ╜Detta är uttydningen: de tre rankorna\\nbetyda tre dagar;\\nom tre dagar skall Farao upphöja ditt huvud och sätta dig åter\\npå din plats, så att du får giva Farao bägaren i handen likasom\\nförut, då du var hans munskänk.\\nMen tänk på mig, när det går dig väl, så att du gör\\nbarmhärtighet med mig och nämner om mig för Farao och skaffar\\nmig ut från detta hus;\\nty jag är med orätt bortförd från hebréernas land, och icke\\nheller här har jag gjort något varför jag borde sättas i\\nfängelse.╜\\n\\nDå nu överste bagaren såg att Josef hade givit en god uttydning,\\nsade han till honom: ╜Också jag hade en dröm.  Jag tyckte att\\njag bar tre vetebrödskorgar på mitt huvud.\\nOch i den översta korgen funnos bakverk av alla slag, sådant som\\nFarao plägar äta; men fåglarna åto därav ur korgen på mitt\\nhuvud.╜\\nDå svarade Josef och sade: ╜Detta är uttydningen: de tre\\nkorgarna betyda tre dagar;\\nom tre dagar skall Farao upphöja ditt huvud och taga det av\\ndig; han skall upphänga dig på trä, och fåglarna skola äta ditt\\nkött.╜\\n\\nPå tredje dagen därefter, då det var Faraos födelsedag, gjorde\\ndenne ett gästabud för alla sina tjänare.  Då upphöjde han, bland\\nsina tjänare, såväl överste munskänkens huvud som överste\\nbagarens.\\nHan insatte överste munskänken åter i hans ämbete, så att han\\nfick giva Farao bägaren i handen;\\nmen överste bagaren lät han upphänga, såsom Josef hade sagt dem\\ni sin uttydning.\\nMen överste munskänken tänkte icke på Josef, utan glömde honom.\\nTvå år därefter hände sig att Farao hade en dröm.  Han tyckte\\nsig stå vid Nilfloden.\\nOch han såg sju kor, vackra och feta, stiga upp ur floden, och\\nde betade i vassen.\\nSedan såg han sju andra kor, fula och magra, stiga upp ur\\nfloden; och de ställde sig bredvid de förra korna på stranden av\\nfloden.\\nOch de fula och magra korna åto upp de sju vackra och feta\\nkorna.  Därefter vaknade Farao.\\nMen han somnade åter in och såg då i drömmen sju ax, frodiga och\\nvackra, växa på samma strå.\\nSedan såg han sju andra ax skjuta upp, tunna och svedda av\\nöstanvinden;\\noch de tunna axen uppslukade de sju frodiga och fulla axen.\\nDärefter vaknade Farao och fann att det var en dröm.\\n\\nDå han nu om morgonen var orolig till sinnes, sände han ut och\\nlät kalla till sig alla spåmän och alla vise i Egypten.  Och\\nFarao förtäljde sina drömmar för dem; men ingen fanns, som kunde\\nuttyda dem för Farao.\\nDå talade överste munskänken till Farao och sade: ╜Jag måste i\\ndag påminna om mina synder.\\nNär Farao en gång var förtörnad på sina tjänare, satte han mig\\njämte överste bagaren i fängelse i drabanthövitsmannens hus.\\nDå hade vi båda, jag och han, under samma natt en dröm, och våra\\ndrömmar hade var sin särskilda betydelse.\\nOch jämte oss var där en ung hebré, som var tjänare hos\\nhövitsmannen för drabanterna.  För honom förtäljde vi våra\\ndrömmar, och han uttydde dem för oss; efter som var och en hade\\ndrömt gav han en uttydning.\\nOch såsom han uttydde för oss, så gick det.  Jag blev åter\\ninsatt på min plats, och den andre blev upphängd.╜\\n\\nDå sände Farao och lät kalla Josef till sig; och man skyndade\\natt föra honom ut ur fängelset.  Och han lät raka sig och bytte\\nom kläder och kom inför Farao.\\nOch Farao sade till Josef: ╜Jag har haft en dröm, och ingen\\nfinnes, som kan uttyda den.  Men jag har hört sägas om dig, att\\nallenast du får höra en dröm, kan du uttyda den.╜\\nJosef svarade Farao och sade: ╜I min makt står det icke; men Gud\\nskall giva Farao ett lyckosamt svar.╜\\nDå sade Farao till Josef: ╜Jag drömde att jag stod på stranden\\nav Nilfloden.\\nOch jag såg sju kor stiga upp ur floden, feta och vackra, och de\\nbetade i vassen.\\nSedan såg jag sju andra kor stiga upp, avfallna och mycket fula\\noch magra; i hela Egyptens land har jag icke sett några så fula\\nsom dessa.\\nOch de magra och fula korna åto upp de sju första, feta korna.\\nMen när de hade sväljt ned dem, kunde man icke märka att de hade\\nsväljt ned dem, utan de förblevo fula såsom förut.  Därefter\\nvaknade jag.\\nÅter drömde jag och såg då sju ax, fulla och vackra, växa på\\nsamma strå.\\nSedan såg jag sju andra ax skjuta upp, förtorkade, tunna och\\nsvedda av östanvinden;\\noch de tunna axen uppslukade de sju vackra axen.  Detta omtalade\\njag för spåmännen; men ingen fanns, som kunde förklara det för\\nmig.╜\\n\\nDå sade Josef till Farao: ╜Faraos drömmar hava en och samma\\nbetydelse; vad Gud ämnar göra, det har han förkunnat för Farao.\\nDe sju vackra korna betyda sju år, de sju vackra axen betyda ock\\nsju år; drömmarna hava en och samma betydelse.\\nOch de sju magra och fula korna som stego upp efter dessa betyda\\nsju år, så ock de sju tomma axen, de som voro svedda av\\nöstanvinden; sju hungerår skola nämligen komma.\\nDetta menade jag, när jag sade till Farao: Vad Gud ämnar göra,\\ndet har han låtit Farao veta.\\nSe, sju år skola komma med stor ymnighet över hela Egyptens\\nland.\\nMen efter dem skola sju hungerår inträffa, sådana, att man skall\\nförgäta all den förra ymnigheten i Egyptens land, och\\nhungersnöden skall förtära landet.\\nOch man skall icke hava något minne av den förra ymnigheten i\\nlandet, för den hungersnöds skull som sedan kommer, ty den skall\\nbliva mycket svår.\\nMen att Farao har haft drömmen två gånger, det betyder att detta\\när av Gud bestämt, och att Gud skall låta det ske snart.\\nMå nu alltså Farao utse en förståndig och vis man, som han kan\\nsätta över Egyptens land.\\nMå Farao göra så; må han ock förordna tillsyningsmän över landet\\noch taga upp femtedelen av avkastningen i Egyptens land under de\\nsju ymniga åren.\\nMå man under dessa kommande goda år samla in allt som kan tjäna\\ntill föda och hopföra säd under Faraos vård i städerna, för att\\ntjäna till föda, och må man sedan förvara den,\\nså att dessa födoämnen finnas att tillgå för landet under de sju\\nhungerår som skola komma över Egyptens land.  Så skall landet\\nicke behöva förgås genom hungersnöden.╜\\n\\nDet talet behagade Farao och alla hans tjänare.\\nOch Farao sade till sina tjänare: ╜Kunna vi finna någon i vilken\\nGuds Ande så är som i denne?╜\\nOch Farao sade till Josef: ╜Eftersom Gud har kungjort för dig\\nallt detta, finnes ingen som är så förståndig och vis som du.\\nDu skall förestå mitt hus, och efter dina befallningar skall\\nallt mitt folk rätta sig; allenast däri att tronen förbliver min\\nvill jag vara förmer än du.╜\\nYtterligare sade Farao till Josef: ╜Jag sätter dig nu över hela\\nEgyptens land.╜\\nOch Farao tog ringen av sin hand och satte den på Josefs hand\\noch lät kläda honom i kläder av fint linne och hängde den\\ngyllene kedjan om hans hals.\\nOch han lät honom åka i vagnen närmast efter sin egen, och man\\nutropade framför honom ╜<spärr>abrek</spärr>╜.  Och han satte\\nhonom över hela Egyptens land.\\nOch Farao sade till Josef: ╜Jag är Farao; utan din vilja skall\\ningen i hela Egyptens land lyfta hand eller fot.╜\\nOch Farao gav Josef namnet Safenat-Panea och gav honom till\\nhustru Asenat, dotter till Poti-Fera, prästen i On.  Och Josef\\nbegav sig ut och besåg Egyptens land.\\n\\nJosef var trettio år gammal, när han stod inför Farao, konungen i\\nEgypten.  Och Josef gick ut ifrån Farao och färdades omkring i\\nhela Egyptens land.\\nOch landet gav under de sju ymniga åren avkastning i överflöd\\noch under dessa sju år som kommo i Egyptens land samlade han in\\nallt som kunde tjäna till föda och lade upp det i städerna.  I\\nvar särskild stad lade han upp de födoämnen som man hämtade\\nifrån fälten däromkring.\\nSå hopförde Josef säd i stor myckenhet, såsom sanden i havet,\\ntill dess man måste upphöra att hålla räkning på den, eftersom\\ndet var omöjligt att hålla räkning på den.\\n\\nOch åt Josef föddes två söner, innan något hungerår kom; de\\nföddes åt honom av Asenat, dotter till Poti-Fera, prästen i On.\\nOch Josef gav åt den förstfödde namnet\\n<spärr>Manasse</spärr>, ╜ty╜, sade han, ╜Gud har låtit mig\\nförgäta all min olycka och hela min faders hus.╜\\nOch åt den andre gav han namnet <spärr>Efraim</spärr>, ╜ty╜,\\nsade han, ╜Gud har gjort mig fruktsam i mitt lidandes land╜.\\n\\nMen de sju ymniga åren som först hade kommit i Egyptens land\\ngingo till ända;\\nsedan begynte de sju hungeråren, såsom Josef hade förutsagt.\\nOch hungersnöd uppstod i alla andra länder; men i Egyptens land\\nfanns bröd överallt.\\nOch när hela Egyptens land begynte hungra och folket ropade till\\nFarao efter bröd, sade Farao till alla egyptier: ╜Gån till\\nJosef, och gören vad han säger eder.╜\\nNär nu alltså hungersnöd var över hela landet, öppnade Josef\\nalla förrådshus och sålde säd åt egyptierna.  Men hungersnöden\\nblev allt större i Egyptens land;\\noch från alla länder kom man till Josef i Egypten för att köpa\\nsäd, ty hungersnöden blev allt större i alla länder.\\n\\nMen när Jakob förnam att säd fanns i Egypten, sade han till sina\\nsöner: ╜Varför stån I så rådlösa?╜\\nOch han sade vidare: ╜Se, jag har hört att i Egypten finnes säd;\\nfaren ditned och köpen därifrån säd åt oss, för att vi må leva\\noch icke dö.╜\\nDå foro tio av Josefs bröder ned för att köpa säd i Egypten.\\nMen Benjamin, Josefs broder, blev icke av Jakob sänd åstad med\\nsina bröder, ty han fruktade att någon olycka kunde hända honom.\\nSå kommo då, bland de andra, också Israels söner för att köpa\\nsäd; ty hungersnöd rådde i Kanaans land.\\n\\nOch Josef var den som hade att befalla i landet; det var han som\\nsålde säd åt allt folket i landet.  Då nu Josefs bröder kommo\\ndit, föllo de ned till jorden på sitt ansikte inför honom.\\nNär då Josef fick se sina bröder, kände han igen dem; men han\\nställde sig främmande mot dem och tilltalade dem hårt och\\nfrågade dem: ╜Varifrån kommen I?╜  De svarade: ╜Från Kanaans\\nland, för att köpa säd till föda åt oss.╜\\nOch fastän Josef kände igen sina bröder, kände de icke igen\\nhonom.\\nMen Josef tänkte på de drömmar som han hade drömt om dem.  Och\\nhan sade till dem: ╜I ären spejare, I haven kommit för att se\\nefter, var landet är utan skydd.╜\\nDe svarade honom: ╜Nej, herre, dina tjänare hava kommit för att\\nköpa säd till föda åt sig.\\nVi äro alla söner till en och samma man; vi äro redliga män,\\ndina tjänare äro inga spejare.╜\\nMen han sade till dem: ╜Jo, I haven kommit för att se efter, var\\nlandet är utan skydd.╜\\nDe svarade: ╜Vi, dina tjänare, äro tolv bröder, söner till en\\noch samma man i Kanaans land; men den yngste är nu hemma hos vår\\nfader, och en är icke mer till.╜\\nJosef sade till dem: ╜Det är såsom jag sade eder: I ären\\nspejare.\\nOch på detta sätt vill jag pröva eder: så sant Farao lever,\\nI skolen icke slippa härifrån, med mindre eder yngste broder\\nkommer hit.\\nEn av eder må fara och hämta hit eder broder.  Men I andra\\nskolen stanna såsom fångar, för att jag så må pröva om I haven\\ntalat sanning.  Ty om så icke är, då ären I spejare, så sant\\nFarao lever.╜\\nDärefter lät han hålla dem allasammans i fängelse under tre\\ndagar.\\n\\nMen på tredje dagen sade Josef till dem: ╜Om I viljen leva, så\\ngören på detta sätt, ty jag fruktar Gud:\\nären I redliga män, så må en av eder, I bröder, stanna såsom\\nfånge i huset där I haven suttit fängslade; men I andra mån fara\\neder väg, och föra hem med eder den säd som I haven köpt till\\nhjälp mot hungersnöden hemma hos eder.\\nFören sedan eder yngste broder hit till mig; om så edra ord visa\\nsig vara sanna, skolen I slippa att dö.╜  Och de måste göra så.\\nMen de sade till varandra: ╜Förvisso hava vi dragit skuld över\\noss genom det som vi gjorde mot vår broder; ty vi sågo hans\\nsjäls ångest, när han bad oss om misskund, och vi ville dock\\nicke lyssna till honom.  Därför hava vi själva kommit i denna\\nångest.╜\\nRuben svarade dem: ╜Sade jag icke till eder: \\'Försynden eder\\nicke på gossen\\'?  Men I lyssnaden icke till mig; se, därför\\nutkräves nu hans blod.╜\\nMen de visste icke att Josef förstod detta, ty han talade med\\ndem genom tolk.\\nOch han vände sig bort ifrån dem och grät.  Sedan vände han sig\\nåter till dem och talade med dem; och han tog Simeon ut ur deras\\nkrets och lät fängsla honom inför deras ögon.\\n\\nOch Josef bjöd att man skulle fylla deras säckar med säd, och\\nlägga vars och ens penningar tillbaka i hans säck, och giva dem\\nkost för resan.  Och man gjorde så med dem.\\nOch de lastade säden på sina åsnor och foro därifrån.\\nMen när vid ett viloställe en av dem öppnade sin säck för att\\ngiva foder åt sin åsna, fick han se sina penningar ligga överst\\ni säcken.\\nDå sade han till sina bröder: ╜Mina penningar hava blivit lagda\\nhit tillbaka; se, de äro här i min säck.╜  Då blevo de utom sig\\nav häpnad och sågo förskräckta på varandra och sade: ╜Vad har\\nGud gjort mot oss!╜\\n\\nNär de kommo hem till sin fader Jakob i Kanaans land, berättade\\nde för honom allt vad som hade hänt dem och sade:\\n╜Mannen som var herre där i landet tilltalade oss hårt och\\nbehandlade oss såsom om vi ville bespeja landet.\\nMen vi sade till honom: \\'Vi äro redliga män och inga spejare;\\nvi äro tolv bröder, samma faders söner; en är icke mer till, och\\nden yngste är nu hemma hos vår fader i Kanaans land.\\'\\nMen mannen som var herre i landet svarade oss: \\'Därav skall jag\\nveta att I ären redliga män: lämnen kvar hos mig en av eder, I\\nbröder; tagen så vad I haven köpt till hjälp mot hungersnöden\\nhemma hos eder, och faren eder väg.\\nSedan mån I föra eder yngste broder hit till mig, så kan jag\\nveta att I icke ären spejare, utan redliga män.  Då skall jag\\ngiva eder broder tillbaka åt eder, och I skolen fritt få draga\\nomkring i landet.\\n\\nNär de sedan tömde sina säckar, fann var och en sin penningpung\\ni sin säck.  Och då de och deras fader fingo se penningpungarna,\\nblevo de förskräckta.\\nOch Jakob, deras fader, sade till dem: ╜I gören mig barnlös;\\nJosef är borta, Simeon är borta, Benjamin viljen I ock taga\\nifrån mig; över mig kommer allt detta.╜\\nDå svarade Ruben sin fader och sade: ╜Mina båda söner må du\\ndöda, om jag icke för honom åter till dig.  Anförtro honom åt\\nmig, jag skall föra honom tillbaka till dig.╜\\nMen han svarade: ╜Min son får icke fara ditned med eder.  Hans\\nbroder är ju död, och han är allena kvar; om nu någon olycka\\nhände honom på den resa I viljen företaga, så skullen I bringa\\nmina grå hår med sorg ned i dödsriket.╜\\nMen hungersnöden var svår i landet.\\nOch när de hade förtärt den säd som de hade hämtat från Egypten,\\nsade deras fader till dem: ╜Faren tillbaka och köpen litet säd\\ntill föda åt oss.╜\\nMen Juda svarade honom och sade: ╜Mannen betygade högtidligt och\\nsade till oss: \\'I fån icke komma inför mitt ansikte, med mindre\\neder broder är med eder.\\'\\nOm du nu låter vår broder följa med oss, så skola vi fara ned\\noch köpa säd till föda åt dig.\\nMen om du icke låter honom följa med oss, så vilja vi icke fara,\\nty mannen sade till oss: \\'I fån icke komma inför mitt ansikte,\\nmed mindre eder broder är med eder.\\'\\nDå sade Israel: ╜Varför gjorden I så illa mot mig och berättaden\\nför mannen att I haden ännu en broder?╜\\nDe svarade: ╜Mannen frågade noga om oss och vår släkt; han sade:\\n\\'Lever eder fader ännu?  Haven I någon broder?\\'  Då omtalade vi\\nför honom huru det förhöll sig.  Kunde vi veta att han skulle\\nsäga: \\'Fören eder broder hitned\\'?╜\\nOch Juda sade till sin fader Israel: ╜Låt ynglingen följa med\\nmig, så vilja vi stå upp och begiva oss åstad, för att vi må\\nleva och icke dö, vi själva och du och våra kvinnor och barn.\\nJag vill ansvara för honom; av min hand må du utkräva honom.  Om\\njag icke för honom åter till dig och ställer honom inför ditt\\nansikte, så vill jag vara en syndare inför dig i all min tid.\\nSannerligen, om vi icke hade dröjt så länge, så skulle vi redan\\nhava varit tillbaka för andra gången.╜\\nDå svarade deras fader Israel dem: ╜Måste det så vara, så gören\\nnu på detta sätt: tagen av landets bästa frukt i edra säckar och\\nfören det till mannen såsom skänk, litet balsam och litet\\nhonung, dragantgummi och ladanum, pistacienötter och mandlar.\\nOch tagen dubbla summan penningar med eder, så att I fören\\ntillbaka dit med eder de penningar som I haven fått igen överst\\ni edra säckar.  Kanhända var det ett misstag.\\nTagen ock eder broder med eder, och stån upp och faren tillbaka\\ntill mannen.\\nMen Gud den Allsmäktige låte eder finna barmhärtighet inför\\nmannen, så att han tillstädjer eder andre broder och Benjamin\\natt återvända med eder.  Men skall jag bliva barnlös, så må det\\ndå ske.╜\\n\\nDå togo männen de nämnda skänkerna och togo med sig dubbla\\nsumman penningar, därtill ock Benjamin, och stodo upp och foro\\nned till Egypten och trädde inför Josef.\\nDå nu Josef såg att Benjamin var med dem, sade han till sin\\nhovmästare: ╜För dessa män in i mitt hus; och låt slakta och\\ntillreda en måltid, ty männen skola äta middag med mig.╜\\nOch mannen gjorde såsom Josef hade sagt och förde männen in i\\nJosefs hus.\\nOch männen blevo förskräckta, när de fördes in i Josefs hus; de\\nsade: ╜Det är på grund av penningarna vi föras hitin, de\\npenningar som förra gången kommo tillbaka i våra säckar; ty han\\nvill nu störta sig på oss och överfalla oss och göra oss själva\\ntill trälar och taga ifrån oss våra åsnor.╜\\nOch de trädde fram till Josefs hovmästare och talade med honom\\nvid ingången till huset\\noch sade: ╜Hör oss, herre.  När vi förra gången voro härnere för\\natt köpa säd till föda åt oss\\noch sedan kommo till ett viloställe och öppnade våra säckar, då\\nfann var och en av oss sina penningar överst i sin säck,\\npenningarna till deras fulla vikt; dem hava vi nu fört tillbaka\\nmed oss.\\nOch vi hava tagit andra penningar med oss för att köpa säd till\\nföda åt oss.  Vi veta icke vem som hade lagt penningarna i våra\\nsäckar.╜\\nDå svarade han: ╜Varen vid gott mod, frukten icke; det är eder\\nGud och eder faders Gud som har låtit eder finna en skatt i edra\\nsäckar; edra penningar har jag fått.╜  Sedan hämtade han Simeon\\nut till dem.\\nOch han förde männen in i Josefs hus och gav dem vatten till att\\ntvå sina fötter och gav foder åt deras åsnor.\\nOch de ställde i ordning sina skänker, till dess Josef skulle\\nkomma hem om middagen; ty de hade fått höra att de skulle äta\\ndär.\\n\\nNär sedan Josef hade kommit hem, förde de skänkerna, som de hade\\nmed sig, in till honom i huset och föllo ned för honom till\\njorden.\\nOch han hälsade dem och frågade: ╜Står det väl till med eder\\nfader, den gamle, som I taladen om?  Lever han ännu?╜\\nDe svarade: ╜Ja, det står väl till med vår fader, din tjänare;\\nhan lever ännu.╜  Och de bugade sig och föllo ned för honom.\\nOch när han lyfte upp sina ögon och fick se sin broder Benjamin,\\nsin moders son, frågade han: ╜Är detta eder yngste broder, den\\nsom I taladen om med mig?╜  Därpå sade han: ╜Gud vare dig nådig,\\nmin son.╜\\nMen Josef bröt av sitt tal, ty hans hjärta upprördes av kärlek\\ntill brodern, och han sökte tillfälle att gråta ut och gick in i\\nsin kammare och grät där.\\nDärefter, sedan han hade tvagit sitt ansikte, gick han åter ut\\noch betvang sig och sade: ╜Sätten fram mat.╜\\nOch de satte fram särskilt för honom och särskilt för dem och\\nsärskilt för de egyptier som åto tillsammans med honom; ty\\negyptierna få icke äta tillsammans med hebréerna; sådant är\\nnämligen en styggelse för egyptierna.\\nOch de fingo sina platser mitt emot honom, den förstfödde främst\\nsåsom den förstfödde, sedan de yngre, var och en efter sin\\nålder; och männen sågo med förundran på varandra.\\nOch han lät bära till dem av rätterna på sitt bord, och Benjamin\\nfick fem gånger så mycket som var och en av de andra.  Och de\\ndrucko sig glada med honom.\\nDärefter bjöd han sin hovmästare och sade: ╜Fyll männens säckar\\nmed säd, så mycket de kunna rymma, och lägg vars och ens\\npenningar överst i hans säck.\\nOch min bägare, silverbägaren, skall du lägga överst i den\\nyngstes säck, tillika med penningarna för hans säd.╜  Och han\\ngjorde såsom Josef hade sagt.\\nOm morgonen, då det blev dager, fingo männen fara med sina\\nåsnor.\\nMen när de hade kommit ett litet stycke utom staden, sade Josef\\ntill sin hovmästare: ╜Stå upp och sätt efter männen; och när du\\nhinner upp dem, så säg till dem: \\'Varför haven I lönat gott med\\nont?\\nDet är ju just den bägaren som min herre dricker ur, och som han\\nplägar spå med.  Det är en ond gärning I haven gjort.\\'╜\\n\\nNär han nu hann upp dem, sade han detta till dem.\\nDå svarade de honom: ╜Varför talar min herre så?  Bort det, att\\ndina tjänare skulle göra sådant!\\nDe penningar som vi funno överst i våra säckar hava vi ju fört\\ntillbaka till dig från Kanaans land.  Huru skulle vi då kunna\\nvilja stjäla silver eller guld ur din herres hus?\\nDen bland dina tjänare, som den finnes hos, han må dö; därtill\\nvilja vi andra bliva min herres trälar.╜\\nHan svarade: ╜Ja, vare det såsom I haven sagt; den som den\\nfinnes hos, han skall bliva min träl.  Men I andra skolen vara\\nutan skuld.╜\\nOch de skyndade sig att lyfta ned var och en sin säck på jorden,\\noch öppnade var och en sin säck.\\nOch han begynte att söka hos den äldste och slutade hos den\\nyngste; och bägaren fanns i Benjamins säck.\\nDå revo de sönder sina kläder och lastade åter var och en sin\\nåsna och vände tillbaka till staden.\\n\\nOch Juda och hans bröder gingo in i Josefs hus, där denne ännu\\nvar kvar; och de föllo ned till jorden för honom.\\nDå sade Josef till dem: ╜Vad haven I gjort!  Förstoden I icke\\natt en man sådan som jag kan spå?╜\\nJuda svarade: Vad skola vi säga till min herre, vad skola vi\\ntala, och huru skola vi rättfärdiga oss?  Gud har funnit dina\\ntjänares missgärning.  Se, vi äro min herres trälar, vi andra\\nsåväl som den som bägaren har blivit funnen hos.╜\\nMen han sade: ╜Bort det, att jag skulle så göra!  Den som\\nbägaren har blivit funnen hos, han skall bliva min träl.  Men I\\nandra mån i frid fara hem till eder fader.╜\\n\\nDå trädde Juda fram till honom och sade: ╜Hör mig, herre; låt\\ndin tjänare tala ett ord inför min herre, och må din vrede icke\\nupptändas mot din tjänare; ty du är såsom Farao.\\nMin herre frågade sina tjänare och sade: \\'Haven I eder fader\\neller någon broder ännu därhemma?\\'\\nOch vi svarade min herre: \\'Vi hava en åldrig fader och en son\\ntill honom, en som är född på hans ålderdom och ännu är ung; men\\nen broder till denne är död, så att han allena är kvar efter sin\\nmoder, och hans fader har honom kär.\\'\\nDå sade du till dina tjänare: \\'Fören honom hitned till mig, så\\natt jag kan låta mitt öga vila på honom.\\'\\nOch vi svarade min herre: \\'Ynglingen kan icke lämna sin fader,\\nty om han lämnade sin fader, så skulle denne dö.\\'\\nMen du sade till dina tjänare: \\'Om eder yngste broder icke\\nföljer med eder hitned, så fån I icke mer komma inför mitt\\nansikte.\\'\\nNär vi därefter hade kommit hem till din tjänare, min fader,\\nberättade vi för honom vad min herre hade sagt.\\nOch när sedan vår fader sade: \\'Faren tillbaka och köpen litet\\nsäd till föda åt oss\\',\\nsvarade vi: \\'Vi kunna icke fara ditned; allenast på det\\nvillkoret vilja vi fara, att vår yngste broder följer med oss;\\nty vi få icke komma inför mannens ansikte om vår yngste broder\\nicke är med oss.\\nMen din tjänare, min fader, sade till oss: \\'I veten själva att\\nmin hustru har fött åt mig två söner,\\noch den ene gick bort ifrån mig, och jag sade: förvisso är han\\nihjälriven.  Och jag har icke sett honom sedan den tiden.\\nOm I nu tagen också denne ifrån mig och någon olycka händer\\nhonom, så skolen I bringa mina grå hår med jämmer ned i\\ndödsriket.\\'\\nOm jag alltså kommer hem till din tjänare, min fader, utan att\\nvi hava med oss ynglingen, som vår faders hjärta är så fäst vid,\\ndå bliver det hans död, när han ser att ynglingen icke är med;\\noch dina tjänare skulle så bringa din tjänares, vår faders, grå\\nhår med sorg ned i dödsriket.\\nTy jag, din tjänare, har lovat min fader att ansvara för\\nynglingen och har sagt, att om jag icke för denne till honom\\nigen, så vill jag vara en syndare inför min fader i all min tid.\\nLåt nu därför din tjänare stanna kvar hos min herre såsom träl,\\ni ynglingens ställe, men låt ynglingen fara hem med sina bröder.\\nTy huru skulle jag kunna fara hem till min fader utan att hava\\nynglingen med mig?  Jag förmår icke se den jämmer som då skulle\\nkomma över min fader.╜\\nDå kunde Josef icke längre betvinga sig inför alla dem som stodo\\nomkring honom.  Han ropade: ╜Må alla gå ut härifrån.╜  Och ingen\\nfick stanna inne hos Josef, när han gav sig till känna för sina\\nbröder.\\nOch han brast ut i högljudd gråt, så att egyptierna hörde det;\\nockså Faraos husfolk hörde det.\\nOch Josef sade till sina bröder: ╜Jag är Josef.  Lever min fader\\nännu?╜  Men hans bröder kunde icke svara honom, så förskräckta\\nblevo de för honom.\\nDå sade Josef till sina bröder: ╜Kommen hitfram till mig.╜  Och\\nnär de kommo fram, sade han: ╜Jag är Josef, eder broder, som I\\nsålden till Egypten.\\nMen varen nu icke bedrövade och grämen eder icke däröver att I\\nhaven sålt mig hit: ty för att bevara människors liv har Gud\\nsänt mig hit före eder.\\nI två år har nu hungersnöd varit i landet, och ännu återstå fem\\når under vilka man varken skall plöja eller skörda.\\nMen Gud sände mig hit före eder, för att I skullen bliva kvar på\\njorden och behållas vid liv, ja, till räddning för många.\\nSå haven nu icke I sänt mig hit, utan Gud; och han har gjort mig\\ntill Faraos högste rådgivare och till en herre över hela hans\\nhus och till en furste över hela Egyptens land.\\nSkynden eder nu och faren hem till min fader, och sägen till\\nhonom: \\'Så säger din son Josef: Gud har satt mig till en herre\\növer hela Egypten; kom ned till mig, dröj icke.\\nDu skall få bo i landet Gosen och vara mig nära, du med dina\\nbarn och barnbarn, dina får och fäkreatur och allt vad som\\ntillhör dig.\\nJag vill där försörja dig -- ty ännu återstå fem hungerår -- så\\natt varken du eller ditt hus eller någon som hör dig till skall\\nlida nöd.\\nI sen ju med egna ögon, också min broder Benjamin ser med egna\\nögon, att det är jag, som med egen mun talar till eder.\\nBerätten nu för min fader om all min härlighet i Egypten och om\\nallt vad I haven sett, och skynden eder att föra min fader\\nhitned.╜\\nSå föll han sin broder Benjamin om halsen och grät, och Benjamin\\ngrät vid hans hals.\\nOch han kysste alla sina bröder och grät i deras armar.  Sedan\\nsamtalade hans bröder med honom.\\n\\nNär nu det ryktet spordes i Faraos hus, att Josefs bröder hade\\nkommit, behagade detta Farao och hans tjänare väl.\\nOch Farao sade till Josef: ╜Säg till dina bröder: \\'Detta skolen\\nI göra: lasten edra djur och faren hem till Kanaans land;\\nhämten så eder fader och edert folk och kommen hit till mig, så\\nskall jag giva eder det bästa som finnes i Egyptens land, och I\\nskolen få äta av landets fetma.\\'\\nAlltså bjuder jag dig nu att säga: \\'Detta skolen I göra: tagen\\neder vagnar i Egyptens land för edra späda barn och edra\\nhustrur, och hämten eder fader och kommen hit.\\nOch bekymren eder icke om edert bohag; ty det bästa som finnes i\\nhela Egyptens land skall höra eder till.\\'╜\\nIsraels söner gjorde så, och Josef gav dem vagnar, efter Faraos\\nbefallning, och gav dem kost för resan.\\nOch han gav åt dem alla var sin högtidsdräkt, men åt Benjamin\\ngav han tre hundra siklar silver och fem högtidsdräkter.\\nOch till sin fader sände han likaledes gåvor: tio åsnor, lastade\\nmed det bästa Egypten hade, och tio åsninnor, lastade med säd\\noch bröd och andra livsmedel åt hans fader för resan.\\nDärefter lät han sina bröder fara, och de begåvo sig åstad; och\\nhan sade till dem: ╜Kiven icke på vägen.╜\\nSå foro de upp från Egypten och kommo till sin fader Jakob i\\nKanaans land;\\noch de berättade för honom och sade: ╜Josef lever ännu, och han\\när en furste över hela Egyptens land.╜  Då greps hans hjärta av\\nvanmakt, ty han kunde icke tro dem.\\nMen när de omtalade för honom allt vad Josef hade sagt till dem,\\noch när han såg vagnarna som Josef hade sänt för att hämta\\nhonom, då fick deras fader Jakobs ande åter liv.\\nOch Israel sade: ╜Det är nog; min son Josef lever ännu.

Och när han kom fram till honom, föll\\nhan honom om halsen och grät länge vid hans hals.\\nOch Israel sade till Josef: ╜Nu vill jag gärna dö, sedan jag har\\nsett ditt ansikte och sett att du ännu lever.╜\\n\\nDärefter sade Josef till sina bröder och sin faders folk: ╜Jag\\nvill fara upp och berätta för Farao och säga till honom: \\'Mina\\nbröder och min faders folk, som hittills hava bott i Kanaans\\nland, hava kommit till mig.\\nOch dessa män äro fårherdar, ty de hava idkat boskapsskötsel;\\noch sina får och fäkreatur och allt vad de äga hava de fört med\\nsig.\\'\\nNär sedan Farao kallar eder till sig och frågar: \\'Vad är edert\\nyrke?\\',\\nskolen I svara: \\'Vi, dina tjänare, hava idkat boskapsskötsel\\nfrån vår ungdom ända till nu, vi såväl som våra fäder.\\'  Så\\nskolen I få bo i landet Gosen; ty alla fårherdar äro en\\nstyggelse för egyptierna.╜\\nOch Josef kom och berättade för Farao och sade: ╜Min fader och\\nmina bröder hava kommit från Kanaans land med sina får och\\nfäkreatur och allt vad de äga; och de äro nu i landet Gosen.╜\\nOch han hade bland sina bröder tagit ut fem män; dem ställde han\\nfram inför Farao.\\nDå frågade Farao hans bröder: ╜Vad är edert yrke?╜  De svarade\\nFarao: ╜Dina tjänare äro fårherdar, såsom ock våra fäder hava\\nvarit.╜\\nOch de sade ytterligare till Farao: ╜Vi hava kommit för att bo\\nnågon tid här i landet; ty dina tjänare hade intet bete för sina\\nfår, eftersom hungersnöden är så svår i Kanaans land.  Så låt nu\\ndina tjänare bo i landet Gosen.╜\\nDå sade Farao till Josef: ╜Din fader och dina bröder hava alltså\\nnu kommit till dig.\\nEgyptens land ligger öppet för dig; i den bästa delen av landet\\nmå du låta din fader och dina bröder bo.  Må de bo i landet\\nGosen, och ifall du vet om några bland dem att de äro dugande\\nmän, så sätt dessa till uppsyningsmän över min boskap.╜\\n\\nSedan hämtade Josef sin fader Jakob och förde honom fram inför\\nFarao, och Jakob hälsade Farao.\\nMen Farao frågade Jakob: ╜Huru hög är din ålder?╜\\nJakob svarade Farao: ╜Min vandringstid har varat ett hundra\\ntrettio år.  Få och onda hava mina levnadsår varit, de nå icke\\nupp till antalet av mina fäders levnadsår under deras\\nvandringstid.╜\\nOch Jakob tog avsked av Farao och gick ut ifrån honom.\\nMen Josef lät sin fader och sina bröder bo i Egyptens land och\\ngav dem besittning där, i den bästa delen av landet, i landet\\nRameses, såsom Farao hade bjudit.\\nOch Josef försörjde sin fader och sina bröder och hela sin\\nfaders hus, och gav var och en underhåll efter antalet av hans\\nbarn.\\n\\nMen ingenstädes i landet fanns bröd, ty hungersnöden var mycket\\nsvår, så att Egyptens land och Kanaans land försmäktade av\\nhunger.\\nOch för den säd som folket köpte samlade Josef till sig alla\\npenningar som funnos i Egyptens land och i Kanaans land; och\\nJosef lät föra penningarna in i Faraos hus.\\nMen när penningarna togo slut i Egyptens land och i Kanaans\\nland, kommo alla egyptier till Josef och sade: ╜Giv oss bröd;\\nicke vill du väl att vi skola dö i din åsyn?  Vi hava ju inga\\npenningar mer.╜\\nJosef svarade: ╜Fören hit eder boskap, så skall jag giva eder\\nbröd i utbyte mot eder boskap, om I icke mer haven några\\npenningar.╜\\nDå förde de sin boskap till Josef, och Josef gav dem bröd i\\nutbyte mot deras hästar, får, fäkreatur och åsnor.  Så underhöll\\nhan dem det året och gav dem bröd i utbyte mot all deras boskap.\\nSå gick detta år till ända.  Men det följande året kommo de åter\\ntill honom och sade till honom: ╜Vi vilja icke dölja det för\\nmin herre: penningarna äro slut, och den boskap vi ägde har\\nkommit i min herres ägo; intet annat finnes nu kvar att giva åt\\nmin herre än våra kroppar och vår jord.\\nIcke vill du att vi skola förgås inför dina ögon, vi med vår\\nåkerjord?  Köp oss och vår jord för bröd, så vilja vi med vår\\njord bliva Faraos trälar; giv oss allenast utsäde, för att vi må\\nleva och icke dö, och för att jorden icke må läggas öde.╜\\nDå köpte Josef all jord i Egypten åt Farao; ty egyptierna sålde\\nvar och en sin åker, eftersom hungersnöden så svårt tryckte dem.\\nSå blev jorden Faraos egendom.\\nOch folket förflyttade han till städerna, från den ena ändan av\\nEgyptens område till den andra.\\nAllenast prästernas jord köpte han icke, ty prästerna hade sitt\\nbestämda underhåll av Farao, och de levde av det bestämda\\nunderhåll som Farao gav dem; därför behövde de icke sälja sin\\njord.\\nOch Josef sade till folket: ╜Se, jag har nu köpt eder och eder\\njord åt Farao.  Där haven I utsäde; besån nu jorden.\\nOch när grödan kommer in, skolen I giva en femtedel åt Farao;\\nmen fyra femtedelar skolen I själva hava till utsäde på åkern\\noch till föda för eder och dem som I haven i edra hus och till\\nföda för edra barn.╜\\nDe svarade: ╜Du har behållit oss vid liv; låt oss finna nåd för\\nmin herres ögon, så vilja vi vara Faraos trälar.╜\\nSå gjorde Josef det till en stadga, som ännu i dag gäller för\\nEgyptens jord, att man skulle giva femtedelen åt Farao.\\nAllenast prästernas jord blev icke Faraos egendom.\\n\\nSå bodde nu Israel i Egyptens land, i landet Gosen; och de fingo\\nsina besittningar där och voro fruktsamma och förökade sig\\nstorligen.\\nOch Jakob levde sjutton år i Egyptens land, så att hans\\nlevnadsålder blev ett hundra fyrtiosju år.\\nDå nu tiden närmade sig att Israel skulle dö, kallade han till\\nsig sin son Josef och sade till honom: ╜Om jag har funnit nåd\\nför dina ögon, så lägg din hand under min länd och lova att visa\\nmig din kärlek och trofasthet därmed att du icke begraver mig i\\nEgypten;\\nfastmer, när jag har gått till vila hos mina fäder, skall du\\nföra mig från Egypten och begrava mig i deras grav.╜  Han\\nsvarade: ╜Jag skall göra såsom du har sagt.╜\\nMen han sade: ╜Giv mig din ed därpå.╜  Och han gav honom sin ed.\\nDå tillbad Israel, böjd mot sängens huvudgärd.\\nEn tid härefter blev det sagt till Josef: ╜Din fader är nu\\nsjuk.╜  Då tog han med sig sina båda söner, Manasse och Efraim.\\nOch man berättade för Jakob och sade: ╜Din son Josef har nu\\nkommit till dig.╜  Då tog Israel styrka till sig och satte sig\\nupp i sängen.\\nOch Jakob sade till Josef: ╜Gud den Allsmäktige uppenbarade sig\\nför mig i Lus i Kanaans land och välsignade mig\\noch sade till mig: \\'Se, jag skall göra dig fruktsam och föröka\\ndig och låta skaror av folk komma av dig, och skall giva åt din\\nsäd efter dig detta land till evärdlig besittning.\\'\\nDina båda söner, som äro födda åt dig i Egyptens land, innan jag\\nkom hit till dig i Egypten, de skola nu vara mina: Efraim och\\nManasse skola vara mina, likasom Ruben och Simeon.\\nMen de barn som du har fött efter dem skola vara dina; de skola\\nbära sina bröders namn i dessas arvedel.\\nSe, när jag kom från Paddan, dog Rakel ifrån mig i Kanaans land,\\nunder resan, då det ännu var ett stycke väg fram till Efrat; och\\njag begrov henne där vid vägen till Efrat.╜  Stället heter nu\\nBet-Lehem.\\n\\nDå nu Israel fick se Josefs söner, sade han: ╜Vilka äro dessa?╜\\nJosef svarade sin fader: ╜Det är mina söner, som Gud har givit\\nmig här.╜  Då sade han: ╜För dem hit till mig, på det att jag må\\nvälsigna dem.╜\\nOch Israels ögon voro skumma av ålder, så att han icke kunde se.\\nSå förde han dem då fram till honom, och han kysste dem och tog\\ndem i famn.\\nOch Israel sade till Josef: ╜Jag hade icke tänkt att jag skulle\\nfå se ditt ansikte, men nu har Gud låtit mig se till och med\\navkomlingar av dig.╜\\nOch Josef förde dem bort ifrån hans knän och föll ned till\\njorden på sitt ansikte.\\nSedan tog Josef dem båda vid handen, Efraim i sin högra hand,\\ntill vänster framför Israel, och Manasse i sin vänstra hand,\\ntill höger framför Israel, och förde dem så fram till honom.\\nMen Israel räckte ut sin högra hand och lade den på Efraims\\nhuvud, fastän han var den yngre, och sin vänstra hand på\\nManasses huvud; han lade alltså sina händer korsvis, ty Manasse\\nvar den förstfödde.\\nOch han välsignade Josef och sade: ╜Den Gud inför vilken mina\\nfäder, Abraham och Isak, hava vandrat, den Gud som har varit min\\nherde från min födelse ända till denna dag,\\nden ängel som har förlossat mig från allt ont, han välsigne\\ndessa barn; och må de uppkallas efter mitt och mina fäders,\\nAbrahams och Isaks, namn, och må de föröka sig och bliva talrika\\npå jorden.╜\\nMen när Josef såg att hans fader lade sin högra hand på Efraims\\nhuvud, misshagade detta honom, och han fattade sin faders hand\\noch ville flytta den från Efraims huvud på Manasses huvud.\\nOch Josef sade till sin fader: ╜Icke så, min fader; denne är den\\nförstfödde, lägg din högra hand på hans huvud.╜\\nMen hans fader ville icke; han sade: ╜Jag vet det, min son, jag\\nvet det; också av honom skall ett folk komma, också han skall\\nbliva stor; men hans yngre broder skall dock bliva större än\\nhan, och hans avkomma skall bliva ett talrikt folk.╜\\nSå välsignade han dem på den dagen och sade: ╜Med ditt namn\\nskall Israel välsigna, så att man skall säga: Gud göre dig lik\\nEfraim och Manasse.╜  Så satte han Efraim framför Manasse.\\n\\nOch Israel sade till Josef: ╜Se, jag dör; men Gud skall vara med\\neder och föra eder tillbaka till edra fäders land.\\nOch utöver vad jag giver dina bröder giver jag dig en särskild\\n<spärr>höjdsträcka</spärr> som jag med mitt svärd och min\\nbåge har tagit från amoréerna.╜\\n\\nOch Jakob kallade sina söner till sig och sade: Församlen eder,\\npå det att jag må förkunna eder vad som skall hända eder i\\nkommande dagar:\\n\\nKommen tillhopa och hören, I Jakobs söner;\\n  hören på eder fader Israel.\\n\\nRuben, min förstfödde är du,\\n  min kraft och min styrkas förstling,\\n  främst i myndighet och främst i makt.\\nDu sjuder över såsom vatten,\\n  du skall icke bliva den främste,\\n  ty du besteg din faders läger;\\n  då gjorde du vad skändligt var.\\n  Ja, min bädd besteg han!\\n\\nSimeon och Levi äro bröder;\\n  deras vapen äro våldets verktyg.\\nMin själ inlåte sig ej i deras råd,\\n  min ära tage ingen del i deras samkväm;\\n  ty i sin vrede dräpte de män,\\n  och i sitt överdåd stympade de oxar.\\nFörbannad vare deras vrede, som är så våldsam,\\n  och deras grymhet, som är så hård!\\n  Jag skall förströ dem i Jakob,\\n  jag skall förskingra dem i Israel.\\n\\nDig, Juda, dig skola dina bröder <spärr>prisa</spärr>;\\n  din hand skall vara på dina fienders nacke,\\n  för dig skola din faders söner buga sig.\\nEtt ungt lejon är Juda;\\n  från rivet byte har du dragit ditupp, min son.\\n  Han har lagt sig ned, han vilar såsom ett lejon,\\n  såsom en lejoninna -- vem vågar oroa honom?\\nSpiran skall icke vika ifrån Juda,\\n  icke härskarstaven ifrån hans fötter,\\n  till dess han kommer till Silo\\n  och folken bliva honom hörsamma.\\nHan binder vid vinträdet sin åsna,\\n  vid ädla rankan sin åsninnas fåle.\\n  Han tvår sina kläder i vin,\\n  sin mantel i druvors blod.\\nHans ögon äro dunkla av vin\\n  och hans tänder vita av mjölk.\\n\\nSebulon skall bo vid havets strand,\\n  vid stranden, där skeppen ligga;\\n  sin sida skall han vända mot Sidon.\\n\\nIsaskar är en stark åsna,\\n  som ligger i ro i sin inhägnad.\\nOch han såg att viloplatsen var god,\\n  och att landet var ljuvligt;\\n  då böjde han sin rygg under bördor\\n  och blev en arbetspliktig tjänare.\\n\\nDan skall <spärr>skaffa rätt</spärr> åt sitt folk,\\n  han såväl som någon av Israels stammar.\\nDan skall vara en orm på vägen,\\n  en huggorm på stigen,\\n  en som biter hästen i foten,\\n  så att ryttaren faller baklänges av.\\nHERRE, jag bidar efter din frälsning!\\n\\nGad skall trängas av <spärr>skaror</spärr>,\\n  men själv skall han tränga dem på hälarna.\\n\\nFrån Aser kommer fetma, honom till mat;\\n  konungsliga läckerheter har han att giva.\\n\\nNaftali är en snabb hind;\\n  han har sköna ord att giva.\\n\\nEtt ungt fruktträd är Josef,\\n  ett ungt fruktträd vid källan;\\n  dess grenar nå upp över muren.\\nBågskyttar oroa honom,\\n  de skjuta på honom och ansätta honom;\\ndock förbliver hans båge fast,\\n  och hans händer och armar spänstiga,\\n  genom dens händer, som är den Starke i Jakob,\\n  genom honom som är herden, Israels klippa,\\ngenom din faders Gud -- han skall hjälpa dig.\\n  genom den Allsmäktige -- han skall välsigna dig\\n  med välsignelser från himmelen därovan,\\n  välsignelser från djupet som utbreder sig därnere,\\n  välsignelser från bröst och sköte.\\nDin faders välsignelser nå högt,\\n  högre än mina förfäders välsignelser,\\n  de nå upp till de eviga höjdernas härlighet.\\n  De skola komma över Josefs huvud,\\n  över dens hjässa, som är en furste bland sina bröder.\\n\\nBenjamin är en glupande ulv;\\n  om morgonen förtär han rov,\\n  och om aftonen utskiftar han byte.╜\\n\\nAlla dessa äro Israels stammar, tolv till antalet, och detta är\\nvad deras fader talade till dem, när han välsignade dem; åt var\\noch en av dem gav han sin särskilda välsignelse.\\n\\nOch han bjöd dem och sade till dem: ╜Jag skall nu samlas till\\nmitt folk; begraven mig bredvid mina fäder, i grottan på hetiten\\nEfrons åker,\\ni den grotta som ligger på åkern i Makpela, gent emot Mamre, i\\nKanaans land, den åker som Abraham köpte till egen grav av\\nhetiten Efron,\\ndär de hava begravit Abraham och hans hustru Sara, där de ock\\nhava begravit Isak och hans hustru Rebecka, och där jag själv\\nhar begravit Lea,\\npå den åkern som jämte grottan där köptes av Hets barn.╜\\nNär Jakob hade givit sina söner denna befallning, drog han sina\\nfötter upp i sängen; och han gav upp andan och blev samlad till\\nsina fäder.\\n\\nDå föll Josef ned över sin faders ansikte och grät över honom\\noch kysste honom.\\nOch Josef bjöd läkarna som han hade i sin tjänst att de skulle\\nbalsamera hans fader; och läkarna balsamerade Israel.\\nDärtill åtgingo fyrtio dagar; så många dagar åtgå nämligen för\\nbalsamering.  Och egyptierna begräto honom i sjuttio dagar.\\n\\nMen när gråtodagarna efter honom voro förbi, talade Josef till\\nFaraos husfolk och sade: ╜Om jag har funnit nåd för edra ögon,\\nså framfören till Farao dessa mina ord:\\nMin fader har tagit en ed av mig och sagt: \\'När jag är död,\\nbegrav mig då i den grav som jag har låtit gräva åt mig i\\nKanaans land.\\'  Så låt mig nu fara ditupp och begrava min fader;\\nsedan skall jag komma tillbaka igen.╜\\nFarao svarade: ╜Far ditupp och begrav din fader, efter den ed\\nsom han har tagit av dig.╜\\nDå for Josef upp för att begrava sin fader, och med honom foro\\nalla Faraos tjänare, de äldste i hans hus och alla de äldste i\\nEgyptens land,\\ndärtill allt Josefs husfolk och hans bröder och hans faders\\nhusfolk; allenast sina kvinnor och barn, och sina får och\\nfäkreatur lämnade de kvar i landet Gosen.\\nOch med honom foro ditupp både vagnar och ryttare; och det var\\nen mycket stor skara.\\nNär de nu kommo till Goren-Haatad, på andra sidan Jordan, höllo\\nde där en mycket stor och högtidlig dödsklagan, och han\\nanställde en sorgefest efter sin fader i sju dagar.\\nOch när landets inbyggare, kananéerna, sågo sorgefesten i\\nGoren-Haatad, sade de: ╜Det är en högtidlig\\n<spärr>sorgefest</spärr> som <spärr>egyptierna</spärr> här\\nhålla.╜  Därav fick stället namnet Abel-Misraim; det ligger på\\nandra sidan Jordan.\\n\\nOch hans söner gjorde med honom såsom han hade bjudit dem:\\nhans söner förde honom till Kanaans land och begrovo honom i\\ngrottan på åkern i Makpela, den åker som Abraham hade köpt till\\negen grav av hetiten Efron, gent emot Mamre.\\nOch sedan Josef hade begravit sin fader, vände han tillbaka till\\nEgypten med sina bröder och alla dem som hade farit upp med\\nhonom för att begrava hans fader.\\n\\nMen när Josefs bröder sågo att deras fader var död, tänkte de:\\n╜Kanhända skall Josef nu bliva hätsk mot oss och vedergälla oss\\nallt det onda som vi hava gjort mot honom.╜\\nDärför sände de bud till Josef och läto säga: ╜Din fader bjöd\\noss så före sin död:\\n\\'Så skolen I säga till Josef: Käre, förlåt dina bröder vad de\\nhava brutit och syndat, i det att de hava handlat så illa mot\\ndig.\\'  Förlåt alltså nu din faders Guds tjänare vad de hava\\nbrutit.╜  Och Josef grät, när de läto säga detta till honom.\\nSedan kommo ock hans bröder själva och föllo ned för honom och\\nsade: ╜Se, vi vilja vara tjänare åt dig.╜\\nMen Josef sade till dem: ╜Frukten icke.  Hållen I då mig för\\nGud?\\nI tänkten ont mot mig, men Gud har tänkt det till godo, för att\\nlåta det ske, som nu har skett, och så behålla mycket folk vid\\nliv.\\nFrukten därför nu icke; jag skall försörja eder och edra kvinnor\\noch barn.╜  Och han tröstade dem och talade vänligt med dem.\\n\\nOch Josef bodde kvar i Egypten med sin faders hus; och Josef\\nblev ett hundra tio år gammal.\\nOch Josef fick se Efraims barn till tredje led; också av Makir,\\nManasses son, föddes barn i Josefs sköte.\\nOch Josef sade till sina bröder: ╜Jag dör, men Gud skall\\nförvisso se till eder, och föra eder upp från detta land till\\ndet land som han med ed har lovat åt Abraham, Isak och Jakob.╜\\nOch Josef tog en ed av Israels barn och sade: ╜När nu Gud ser\\ntill eder, fören då mina ben härifrån.╜\\nOch Josef dog, när han var ett hundra tio år gammal.  Och man\\nbalsamerade honom, och han lades i en kista, i Egypten.\\n'"
